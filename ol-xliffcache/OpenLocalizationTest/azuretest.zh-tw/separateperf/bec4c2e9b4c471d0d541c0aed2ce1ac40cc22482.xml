Service Fabric offers two high-level programming models for building services: the reliable actor APIs and the reliable services APIs. While both are built on the same Service Fabric core, they make different trade-offs between simplicity and flexibility in terms of concurrency, partitioning, and communication. It is useful to understand both models so that you can choose the appropriate framework for a particular service within your application.\n\n- [Choose a Programming Model](service-fabric-choose-framework.md)\n- [Introduction to the Service Fabric Actor Model](service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction.md)\n- [Reliable Service Programming Model Introduction](../Service-Fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction.md)\n\n## Reliable Actor programming model\n Reliable Actors provide an asynchronous, single-threaded actor model. The actors represent the unit of state and computation that are distributed throughout the cluster to achieve high scalability. Reliable Actor model leverages the distributed store provided by underlying Service Fabric platform to provide highly available and consistent state management for the application developers.
