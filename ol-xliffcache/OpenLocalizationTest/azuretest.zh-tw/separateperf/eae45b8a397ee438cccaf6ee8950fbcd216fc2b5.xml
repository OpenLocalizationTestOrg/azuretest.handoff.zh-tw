Using Azure Automation, manual, frequently-repeated, long-running, and error-prone tasks can be automated to increase reliability, efficiency, and time to value for your organization.\n\nAzure Automation provides a highly-reliable, highly-available workflow execution engine that scales to meet your needs. In Azure Automation, processes can be kicked off manually, by 3rd-party systems, or at scheduled intervals so that tasks happen exactly when needed.\n\nReduce operational overhead and free up IT and DevOps staff to focus on work that adds business value by moving your cloud management tasks to be run automatically by Azure Automation.\n\n\n## How can Azure Automation help manage Azure API Management?\n\nAPI Management can be managed in Azure Automation by using the [API Management REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn776326.aspx). Within Azure Automation you can write PowerShell workflow scripts to perform many of your API Management tasks using the REST API. You can also pair these REST API calls in Azure Automation with the cmdlets for other Azure services, to automate complex tasks across Azure services and 3rd party systems.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you've learned the basics of Azure Automation and how it can be used to manage Azure API Management, follow these links to learn more.\n\n* See the Azure Automation [Getting Started Tutorial](../automation-create-runbook-from-samples.md).\n* Read the [PowerShell Module for the #Azure API Management REST APIs](https://alexandrebrisebois.wordpress.com/2014/08/17/powershell-module-for-the-azure-api-management-rest-apis/) community blog post.\n \ntest\n"
