The asset delivery policy tells Media Services how you want for your asset to be delivered: into which streaming protocol should your asset be dynamically packaged (for example, MPEG DASH, HLS, Smooth Streaming, or all), whether or not you want to dynamically encrypt your asset and how (envelope or common encryption). \n\nThis topic discusses why and how to create and configure asset delivery policies. \n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]To be able to use dynamic packaging and dynamic encryption, you must make sure to have at least one scale unit (also known as streaming unit). For more information, see [How to Scale a Media Service](media-services-manage-origins.md#scale_streaming_endpoints). \n>\n>Also, your asset must contain a set of adaptive bitrate MP4s or adaptive bitrate Smooth Streaming files.  \n\nYou could apply different policies to the same asset. For example, you could apply PlayReady encryption to Smooth Streaming and AES Envelope encryption to MPEG DASH and HLS. Any protocols that are not defined in a delivery policy (for example, you add a single policy that only specifies HLS as the protocol) will be blocked from streaming. The exception to this is if you have no asset delivery policy defined at all. Then, all protocols will be allowed in the clear.\n\nNote that if your want to delivery a storage encrypted asset, you must configure the asset’s delivery policy. Before your asset can be streamed, the streaming server removes the storage encryption and streams your content using the specified delivery policy. For example, to deliver your asset encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) envelope encryption key, set the policy type to **DynamicEnvelopeEncryption**. To remove storage encryption and stream the asset in the clear, set the policy type to **NoDynamicEncryption**. Examples that show how to configure these policy types follow. \n\nDepending on how you configure the asset delivery policy you would be able to dynamically package, dynamically encrypt, and stream the following streaming protocols: Smooth Streaming, HLS, MPEG DASH, and HDS streams.  \n\nThe following list shows the formats that you use to stream Smooth, HLS, DASH and HDS.  \n\nSmooth Streaming:\n\n    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest\n\nHLS:\n\n    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)\n\nMPEG DASH\n\n    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest(format=mpd-time-csf) \n\nHDS\n\n    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest(format=f4m-f4f)\n\nFor instructions on how to publish an asset and build a streaming URL, see [Build a streaming URL](media-services-deliver-streaming-content.md).\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] When working with the Media Services REST API, the following considerations apply:\n>\n>When accessing entities in Media Services, you must set specific header fields and values in your HTTP requests. For more information, see [Setup for Media Services REST API Development](media-services-rest-how-to-use.md).\n\n>After successfully connecting to https://media.windows.net, you will receive a 301 redirect specifying another Media Services URI. You must make subsequent calls to the new URI as described in [Connecting to Media Services using REST API](media-services-rest-connect_programmatically.md). \n\n\n##Clear asset delivery policy \n\n###<a id=\"create_asset_delivery_policy\"></a>Create asset delivery policy\nThe following HTTP request creates an asset delivery policy that specifies to not apply dynamic encryption and to deliver the stream in any of the following protocols:  MPEG DASH, HLS, and Smooth Streaming protocols. \n\nFor information on what values you can specify when creating an AssetDeliveryPolicy, see the [Types used when defining AssetDeliveryPolicy](#types) section.   \n\n\nRequest:\n      \n    POST https://media.windows.net/api/AssetDeliveryPolicies HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Type: application/json\n    DataServiceVersion: 1.0;NetFx\n    MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0;NetFx\n    Accept: application/json\n    Accept-Charset: UTF-8\n    Authorization: Bearer http%3a%2f%2fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2fws%2f2005%2f05%2fidentity%2fclaims%2fnameidentifier=amsaccount1&urn%3aSubscriptionId=zbbef702-e769-2233-9f16-bc4d3aa97387&http%3a%2f%2fschemas.microsoft.com%2faccesscontrolservice%2f2010%2f07%2fclaims%2fidentityprovider=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&Audience=urn%3aWindowsAzureMediaServices&ExpiresOn=1423397827&Issuer=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&HMACSHA256=Szo6lbJAvL3dyecAeVmyAnzv3mGzfUNClR5shk9Ivbk%3d\n    x-ms-version: 2.11\n    x-ms-client-request-id: 4651882c-d7ad-4d5e-86ab-f07f47dcb41e\n    Host: media.windows.net\n    \n    {\"Name\":\"Clear Policy\",\n    \"AssetDeliveryProtocol\":7,\n    \"AssetDeliveryPolicyType\":2,\n    \"AssetDeliveryConfiguration\":null}\n\nResponse:\n    \n    HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n    Cache-Control: no-cache\n    Content-Length: 363\n    Content-Type: application/json;odata=minimalmetadata;streaming=true;charset=utf-8\n    Location: https://media.windows.net/api/AssetDeliveryPolicies('nb%3Aadpid%3AUUID%3A92b0f6ba-3c9f-49b6-a5fa-2a8703b04ecd')\n    Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.5\n    x-ms-client-request-id: 4651882c-d7ad-4d5e-86ab-f07f47dcb41e\n    request-id: 6aedbf93-4bc2-4586-8845-fd45590136af\n    x-ms-request-id: 6aedbf93-4bc2-4586-8845-fd45590136af\n    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n    DataServiceVersion: 3.0;\n    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET\n    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\n    Date: Sun, 08 Feb 2015 06:21:27 GMT\n    \n    {\"odata.metadata\":\"https://media.windows.net/api/$metadata#AssetDeliveryPolicies/@Element\",\n    \"Id\":\"nb:adpid:UUID:92b0f6ba-3c9f-49b6-a5fa-2a8703b04ecd\",\n    \"Name\":\"Clear Policy\",\n    \"AssetDeliveryProtocol\":7,\n    \"AssetDeliveryPolicyType\":2,\n    \"AssetDeliveryConfiguration\":null,\n    \"Created\":\"2015-02-08T06:21:27.6908329Z\",\n    \"LastModified\":\"2015-02-08T06:21:27.6908329Z\"}\n    \n###<a id=\"link_asset_with_asset_delivery_policy\"></a>Link asset with asset delivery policy\n\nThe following HTTP request links the specified asset to the asset delivery policy to.\n\nRequest:\n\n    POST https://media.windows.net/api/Assets('nb%3Acid%3AUUID%3A86933344-9539-4d0c-be7d-f842458693e0')/$links/DeliveryPolicies HTTP/1.1\n    DataServiceVersion: 1.0;NetFx\n    MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0;NetFx\n    Accept: application/json\n    Accept-Charset: UTF-8\n    Content-Type: application/json\n    Authorization: Bearer http%3a%2f%2fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2fws%2f2005%2f05%2fidentity%2fclaims%2fnameidentifier=amsaccount1&urn%3aSubscriptionId=zbbef702-e769-3344-9f16-bc4d3aa97387&http%3a%2f%2fschemas.microsoft.com%2faccesscontrolservice%2f2010%2f07%2fclaims%2fidentityprovider=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&Audience=urn%3aWindowsAzureMediaServices&ExpiresOn=1423397827&Issuer=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&HMACSHA256=Szo6lbJAvL3dyecAeVmyAnzv3mGzfUNClR5shk9Ivbk%3d\n    x-ms-version: 2.11\n    x-ms-client-request-id: 56d2763f-6e72-419d-ba3c-685f6db97e81\n    Host: media.windows.net\n    \n    {\"uri\":\"https://media.windows.net/api/AssetDeliveryPolicies('nb%3Aadpid%3AUUID%3A92b0f6ba-3c9f-49b6-a5fa-2a8703b04ecd')\"}\n\nResponse:\n\n    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\n\n##DynamicEnvelopeEncryption asset delivery policy \n\n###Create content key of the EnvelopeEncryption type and link it to the asset\n\nWhen specifying DynamicEnvelopeEncryption delivery policy, you need to make sure to link your asset to a content key of the EnvelopeEncryption type.
