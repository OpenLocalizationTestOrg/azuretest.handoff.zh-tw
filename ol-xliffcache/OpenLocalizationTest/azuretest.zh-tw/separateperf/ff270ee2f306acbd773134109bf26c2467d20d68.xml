See [Installing Git] for operating system specific distributions and installation guidance.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE]\n    > On some operating systems, both a command-line and GUI version of Git are available.

On OS X systems you can access the command-line through the **Terminal** application.\n\n3. From the command line, change to the directory where you will store your scripts. For example, `cd SourceControl`.\n\n4. Use the following command to create a local copy of your new Git repository, replacing `<your_git_URL>` with the URL of the Git repository for your mobile service:\n\n        git clone <your_git_URL>\n\n5. When prompted, type in the user name and password that you set when you enabled source control in your mobile service.

Browse to the directory from which you ran the `git clone` command, and notice that a new directory is created with the name of the mobile service.

You can also define a .gitignore file to prevent the package directories from being added.\n\n3. In the Git command prompt, type the following command to start tracking the new script file:\n\n        $ git add .\n\n4. Type the following command to commit changes:\n\n        $ git commit -m \"adding the .NET backend service project\"\n\n5. Type the following command to upload the changes to the remote repository, and supply your credentials:\n\n        $ git push origin master\n\n    You should see a series of commands that indicates that the project is deployed to Mobile Services, packages are added, and the service is restarted.\n\n6.
