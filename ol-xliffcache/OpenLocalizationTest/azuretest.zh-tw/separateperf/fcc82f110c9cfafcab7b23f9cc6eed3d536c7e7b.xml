These instructions will help you:\n\n- Create and manage ExpressRoute circuits\n- Link a Virtual Network to the ExpressRoute circuit\n\n##  Configuration Prerequisites\n\n\nBefore you begin configuration, verify that you have met the following prerequisites:\n\n- Azure subscription\n- Latest version of Windows PowerShell\n- The following Virtual Network requirements:\n    - A set of IP address prefixes to be used in virtual networks in Azure.\n    - A set of IP prefixes on-premises (can contain public IP addresses).\n    - The Virtual Network Gateway must be created with a /28 subnet.\n    - Additional set of IP prefixes (/28) that is outside of the virtual network. This will be used for configuring routes. – You will have to provide this to the network service provider.\n    - AS number for your network. You will have to provide this to the network service provider. You can use private AS numbers. If you choose to do so, it must be > 65000. For more information about AS numbers, see Autonomous System (AS) Numbers. - \n\n- From the network service provider:\n    - You must have a VPN service that is supported with ExpressRoute. Check with your network service provider if your existing VPN service qualifies.\n\n##  Deployment Workflow\n\n![Network Service Provider Workflow](./media/expressroute-configuring-nsps/expressroute-nsp-connectivity-workflow.png)\n\n##  Configuring Settings using PowerShell\nWindows PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment that you can use to control and automate the deployment and management of your workloads in Azure. For more information please refer to the PowerShell documentation in [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/jj156055.aspx)\n\n\n\n1. **Import the PowerShell module for ExpressRoute.**\n\n        Import-Module 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\PowerShell\\ServiceManagement\\Azure\\Azure.psd1'\n        Import-Module 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\PowerShell\\ServiceManagement\\Azure\\ExpressRoute\\ExpressRoute.psd1' \n\n2. **Get the list of providers, locations, and bandwidths supported.**\n\n    Before creating a circuit you will need a list of service providers, supported locations, and bandwidth options for each location. The following PowerShell cmdlet returns this information which you’ll use in later steps.\n\n        PS C:\\> Get-AzureDedicatedCircuitServiceProvider\n\n    The information returned will look similar to the example below:\n\n        PS C:\\> Get-AzureDedicatedCircuitServiceProvider\n    \n        Name                 DedicatedCircuitLocations      DedicatedCircuitBandwidths                                                                                                                                                                                   \n        ----                 -------------------------      --------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                   \n        AT&T                 Silicon Valley,Washington DC   10Mbps:10, 50Mbps:50, 100Mbps:100, 500Mbps:500, 1Gbps:1000                                                                                                                                                   \n        British Telecom      London,Amsterdam               10Mbps:10, 50Mbps:50, 100Mbps:100, 500Mbps:500, 1Gbps:1000                                                                                                                                                   \n        Equinix              Amsterdam,Atlanta,Chicago,Dall 200Mbps:200, 500Mbps:500, 1Gbps:1000, 10Gbps:10000                                                                                                                                                           \n                             as,New York,Seattle,Silicon                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n                             Valley,Washington                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                             DC,London,Hong                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n                             Kong,Singapore,Sydney,Tokyo                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n        IIJ                  Tokyo                          10Mbps:10, 50Mbps:50, 100Mbps:100, 500Mbps:500, 1Gbps:1000                                                                                                                                                   \n        Level 3              London,Silicon                 200Mbps:200, 500Mbps:500, 1Gbps:1000                                                                                                                                                                         \n        Communications -

Making the call without any parameters will list all circuits.
