This customization prepares the cluster for use with the Advanced Analytics Process and Technology (ADAPT) used in Azure Machine Learning. It also shows how to access the headnode to submit custom jobs to the cluster.\n\nThis customization makes many popular Python modules that are included in Anaconda conveniently available for use in user defined functions (UDFs) that are designed to process Hive records in the cluster. For instructions on the procedures used in this scenario, see [Submit Hive Queries to HDInsight Hadoop clusters in the advanced analytics process](machine-learning-data-science-hive-queries.md).\n\n\n## <a name=\"customize\"></a>Customize Azure HDInsight Hadoop Cluster\n\nTo create a customized HDInsight Hadoop cluster, users need to log on to [**Management Portal of Azure**](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), click **New** at the left bottom corner, and then select DATA SERVICES -> HDINSIGHT -> **CUSTOM CREATE** to bring up the **Cluster Details** window. \n\n![Create workspace][1]\n\nInput the name of the cluster to be created on configuration page 1, and accept default values for the other fields.

Otherwise, in fourth configuration page, the storage account that the users want to use will not appear on the dropdown list of **ACCOUNT NAME**.\n\n![Create workspace][3]\n\nOn configuration page 3, provide a user name and password for the HDInsight Hadoop cluster. **Do not** select the _Enter the Hive/Oozie Metastore_. Then, click the arrow to go to the next configuration page. \n\n![Create workspace][4]\n\nOn configuration page 4, specify the storage account name, the default container of the HDInsight Hadoop cluster. If users select _Create default container_ in the **DEFAULT CONTAINER** drop down list, a container with the same name as the cluster will be created.
