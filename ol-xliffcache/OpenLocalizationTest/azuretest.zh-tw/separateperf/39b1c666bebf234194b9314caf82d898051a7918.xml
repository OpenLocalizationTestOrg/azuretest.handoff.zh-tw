This means you can feel confident granting a specific person the right to just exactly what they need. However, at times the resource model for Azure resources can be complicated and it can be difficult to understand exactly what you are granting permissions to.\n\nThis document will let you know what to expect when using some of the new roles in the Azure Portal.  There are three pre-built roles that are included in this release:\n* Owner\n* Contributor\n* Reader\n\nOwners and contributors will have full access to the management experience, the difference being that a contributor can’t give access to other users or groups. Things get a little more interesting with the reader role, so that’s where we’ll spend some time. [See this article](../role-based-access-control-configure.md) for details on how exactly to grant access.\n\n## App Service workloads\n\n### Having read-access only \n\nIf you grant a user, or yourself only have, read access to a single web app, then there may be some features that are disabled that you might not expect. The following management capabilities require **write** access to a web app (either Contributor or Owner), and won’t be available in any read only scenario. \n \n1. Commands (e.g. start, stop, etc.)\n2. Changing settings like general configuration, scale settings, backup settings, and monitoring settings.\n3. Accessing publishing credentials and other secrets like app settings and connection strings.\n4. Streaming logs\n5. Diagnostic logs configuration\n6. Console (command prompt)\n7. Active and recent deployments (for local git continuous deployment)\n8. Estimated spend\n9. Web tests\n10. Virtual network (only visible to a reader if a virtual network has previously been configured by a user with write access).\n \nIf you can't access any of these tiles, you'll need to have Contributor access to the web app. \n\n### Dealing with related resources\n \nWeb apps are complicated by the presence of a few different resources that interplay. Here is a typical resource group with a couple websites:\n\n![Web app resource group](./media/role-based-access-control-troubleshooting/Website-resource-model.png)\n\nAs a result, if you grant someone access to just the website, much functionality on the website blade will be completely disabled. \n \n1. These items require access to the **App Service plan** that corresponds to your website:  \n    * Viewing the web app’s pricing tier (e.g. Free or Standard).\n    * Scale configuration (i.e. # of instances, virtual machine size, autoscale settings).\n    * Quotas (e.g. Storage, bandwidth, CPU).\n2. These items require access to the whole **Resource group** that contains your website:  \n    * SSL Certificates and bindings (This is because SSL certificates can be shared between sites in the same resource group and geo-location).\n    * Alert rules\n    * Autoscale settings\n    * Application insights components\n    * Web tests\n\n## Virtual machine workloads\n\nMuch like with web apps, some features on the virtual machine blade require write access to the virtual machine, or to other resources in the resource group.\n\nVirtual machines have these related resources:\n* Domain names\n* Virtual networks\n* Storage accounts\n* Alert rules\n\n1. These items require **write** access to the Virtual machine:  \n    * Endpoints\n    * IP addresses\n    * Disks\n    * Extensions\n2. These require write access to both the Virtual machine, and the **Resource group** (along with the Domain name) that it is in:  \n    * Availability set\n    * Load balanced set\n    * Alert rules\n    \nIf you can't access any of these tiles, you'll need to ask your administrator for Contributor access to the Resource group. \ntest\n"
