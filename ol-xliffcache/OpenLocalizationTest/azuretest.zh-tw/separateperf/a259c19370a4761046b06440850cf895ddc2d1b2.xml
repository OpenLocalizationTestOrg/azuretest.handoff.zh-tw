This helps prevent issues with connectivity.\n\nTo validate your Azure VNET, do the following:\n\n1. Create an Azure virtual machine inside the subnet of the Azure VNET you want to use with Azure RemoteApp.\n\n2. Connect to that VM by using the **Connect** option in the management portal.\n3. Join the virtual machine to the same domain that you want to use with Azure RemoteApp.\n\nIf this is successful, the Azure VNET is ready to use with RemoteApp.\n\nFor more information about the end-to-end hybrid collection workflow, see the following articles:\n\n- [Create a hybrid collection](remoteapp-create-hybrid-deployment.md)\n- [Deploy Azure RemoteApp collection to your Azure Virtual Network (with support for ExpressRoute)](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rds/archive/2015/04/23/deploy-azure-remoteapp-collection-to-your-azure-virtual-network-with-support-for-expressroute.aspx)\n "
