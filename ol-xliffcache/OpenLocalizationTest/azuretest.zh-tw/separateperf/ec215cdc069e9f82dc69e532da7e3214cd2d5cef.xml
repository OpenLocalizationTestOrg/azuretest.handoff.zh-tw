You will need to consult documentation specific to the platform you are developing for in addition to Azure Mobile Engagement documentation (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, and Windows Phone).\n- Not correctly configuring \"categories\", prevents linking from a notification to another location either inside or outside of the app (Android only). \n- Not setting \"UIKit.framework\" to \"optional\" in your iOS code, shows a \"Symbol not found error\" and/or crashes on older iOS devices (iOS only).\n- Expired certificates or not correctly using the DEV or Prod version of the cert, causes push issues (iOS only).\n- There are some limitations inherent to a platform that Azure Mobile Engagement can't control (like how the system center works for out of app pushes in Android and iOS).\n- Azure Mobile Engagement publishes a full list of the internal packages used by Azure Mobile Engagement for iOS and Android for reference. Keep in mind that some features of Azure Mobile Engagement are specific to the platform (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, and Windows Phone).\n\n### See also\n\n - [Troubleshooting Guide - Push][Link 23] \n - [SDK Documentation - Release Notes][Link 5]\n - [SDK Documentation - Upgrade Guides][Link 5]\n\n## Application crashes\n\n### Issue\n- Your application crashes on the end users' device.\n\n### Causes\n\n- Crash information can be viewed in the *Analytics UI* or the *Analytics API*\n- You can find the Device ID of your test device and take the same action that caused your application to crash for an end user to help identify the cause of your crash.\n- Known issues with the Azure Mobile Engagement SDK that cause applications to crash are sometimes resolved by upgrading to the latest version of the SDK. Make sure to check the release notes about your platform when investigating crashes.\n\n### See also\n\n- [SDK Documentation - Release Notes][Link 5]\n- [SDK Documentation - Upgrade Guides][Link 5]\n\n## App store upload failures\n\n### Issue\n- Errors related to uploading the latest version of your app to Apple, Google, or the Windows App store.\n\n### Causes\n\n- App stores sometimes block apps with certain features enabled (e.g. the Apple Store prevents the use of IDFV in apps in the store and the GooglePlay store prevents the sharing of application information between apps). \n- Make sure that you check the release notes about your platform and current version of the SDK if you have difficulty uploading an app to the store.\n\n<!--Link references-->\n[Link 1]: mobile-engagement-user-interface.md\n[Link 2]: mobile-engagement-troubleshooting-guide.md\n[Link 3]: mobile-engagement-how-tos.md\n[Link 4]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525553\n[Link 5]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525554\n[Link 6]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525555\n[Link 7]: https://account.windowsazure.com/PreviewFeatures\n[Link 8]: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=azuremobileengagement\n[Link 9]: http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mobile-engagement/\n[Link 10]: http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/mobile-engagement/\n[Link 11]: http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/mobile-engagement/\n[Link 12]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-navigation.md\n[Link 13]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-home.md\n[Link 14]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-my-account.md\n[Link 15]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-analytics.md\n[Link 16]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-monitor.md\n[Link 17]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-reach.md\n[Link 18]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-segments.md\n[Link 19]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-dashboard.md\n[Link 20]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-settings.md\n[Link 21]: mobile-engagement-troubleshooting-guide-analytics.md\n[Link 22]: mobile-engagement-troubleshooting-guide-apis.md\n[Link 23]: mobile-engagement-troubleshooting-guide-push-reach.md\n[Link 24]: mobile-engagement-troubleshooting-guide-service.md\n[Link 25]: mobile-engagement-troubleshooting-guide-sdk.md\n[Link 26]: mobile-engagement-troubleshooting-guide-sr-info.md\n[Link 27]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-reach-campaign.md\n[Link 28]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-reach-criterion.md\n[Link 29]: mobile-engagement-user-interface-reach-content.md\n \ntest\n"
