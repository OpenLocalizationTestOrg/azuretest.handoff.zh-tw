This tutorial explains how you can use the **Configure** page to change your StorSimple Snapshot Manager or device administrator password.\n\n## Change the StorSimple Snapshot Manager password\n\nStorSimple Snapshot Manager software resides on your Windows host and allows administrators to manage backups of your StorSimple device in the form of local and cloud snapshots.\n\nWhen configuring a device in StorSimple Snapshot Manager, you will be prompted to provide the device IP address and password to authenticate your storage device. This password is first configured through the Windows PowerShell interface. For more information, see [Step 3: Configure and register the device through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md#step-3-configure-and-register-the-device-through-windows-powershell-for-storsimple) in [Deploy your on-premises StorSimple device](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md).\n\nThe password that was first set through the Windows PowerShell interface during registration can then be changed via the Management Portal. Perform the following steps to change the StorSimple Snapshot Manager password.\n\n#### To change the StorSimple Snapshot Manager password\n\n1. In the portal, click **Devices** > **Configure** for your device.\n\n2. Scroll down to the **StorSimple Snapshot Manager** section. Enter a password that is 14 or 15 characters. Make sure that the password contains a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.\n\n3. Confirm the password.\n\n4. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe StorSimple Snapshot Manager password should now be updated.\n \n## Change the device administrator password\n\nWhen you use Windows PowerShell interface to access the StorSimple device, you are required to enter a device administrator password. When the first StorSimple device is registered with a service, the default password for this interface is *Password1*. For the security of your data, you are required to change this password at the end of the registration process. You cannot exit from the registration process without changing this password. For more information, see [Step 3: Configure and register the device through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md#step-3-configure-and-register-the-device-through-windows-powershell-for-storsimple) in [Deploy your on-premises StorSimple device](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md).\n\nThe password that was first set through the Windows PowerShell interface during registration can then be changed via the Management Portal. Perform the following steps to change the device administrator password.\n\n#### To change the device administrator password\n\n1. In the portal, click **Devices** > **Configure** for your device.\n\n2. Scroll down to the **Device Administrator Password** section. Provide an administrator password that contains from 8 to 15 characters. The password must be a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.\n\n3. Confirm the password.\n\n4. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe device administrator password should now be updated. You can use this modified password to access the Windows PowerShell interface.\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Learn more about StorSimple security](storsimple-security.md).\n\n[Learn more about modifying your device configuration](storsimple-modify-device-config.md)."
