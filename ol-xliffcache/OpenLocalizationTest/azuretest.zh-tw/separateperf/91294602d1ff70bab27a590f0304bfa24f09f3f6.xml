Applications can use the Graph API to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on directory data and objects. For example, you can use the Graph API to create a new user, view or update user’s properties, change user’s password, check group membership for role-based access, disable or delete the user. For more information on the Graph API features and application scenarios, see [Azure AD Graph API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/api/api-catalog) and [Azure AD Graph API Prerequisites](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974464.aspx).\n\n## How to construct a Graph API URL\n\nIn Graph API, in order to access directory data and objects (in other words, resources or entities) against which you want to perform CRUD operations, you can use URLs based on the Open Data (OData) Protocol. The URLs used in Graph API consist of four main parts: service root, tenant identifier, resource path, and query string options: `https://graph.windows.net/{tenant-identifier}/{resource-path}?[query-parameters]`. Take the example of the following URL: `https://graph.windows.net/contoso.com/groups?api-version=1.5`.\n\n- **Service Root**: In Azure AD Graph API, the service root is always https://graph.windows.net.\n- **Tenant identifier**: This can be a verified (registered) domain name, in the example above, contoso.com. It can also be a tenant object ID or the “myorganiztion” or “me” alias. For more information, see [Addressing Entities and Operations in the Graph API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn424880.aspx)).\n- **Resource path**: This section of a URL identifies the resource to be interacted with (users, groups, a particular user, or a particular group, etc.) In the example above, it is the top-level “groups” to address that resource set. You can also address a specific entity, for example “users/{objectId}” or “users/userPrincipalName”.\n- **Query parameters**: ? separates the resource path section from the query parameters section. The “api-version” query parameter is required on all requests in the Graph API. The Graph API also supports the following OData query options: **$filter**, **$orderby**, **$expand**, **$top**, and **$format**. The following query options are not currently supported: **$count**, **$inlinecount**, and **$skip**. For more information, see [Supported Queries, Filters, and Paging Options in Azure AD Graph API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn727074.aspx).\n\n## Graph API versions\n\nThe following versions have been released for the Graph API.\n\n* Version beta\n* Version 1.5\n* Version 2013-11-08\n* Version 2013-04-05\n\nYou specify the version for a Graph API request in the “api-version” query parameter. For version 1.5 you use a numerical version value; api-version=1.5. For previous versions, you use a date string that adheres to the format YYYY-MM-DD; for example, api-version=2013-11-08. For preview features, use the string “beta”; for example, api-version=beta. For more information about differences between Graph API versions, see [Azure AD Graph API Versioning](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835125.aspx).\n\n## Graph API metadata\n\nTo return the Graph API metadata file, add the “$metadata” segment after the tenant-identifier in the URL For example, the following URL returns metadata for the demo company used by the Graph Explorer: `https://graph.windows.net/GraphDir1.OnMicrosoft.com/$metadata?api-version=1.5`. You can enter this URL in the address bar of a web browser to see the metadata. The CSDL metadata document returned describes the entities and complex types, their properties, and the functions and actions exposed by the version of Graph API you requested. Omitting the api-version parameter will return metadata for the most recent version.\n\n## Common queries\n\n[Azure AD Graph API Common Queries](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj126255.aspx) lists common queries that can be used with the Azure AD Graph, including queries that can be used to access top-level resources in your directory and queries to perform operations in your directory.\n\nFor example, `https://graph.windows.net/contoso.com/tenantDetails?api-version=1.5` returns company information for directory contoso.com.\n\nOr `https://graph.windows.net/contoso.com/users?api-version=1.5` lists all user objects in the directory contoso.com.\n\n## Using the Graph Explorer\n\nYou can use the Graph Explorer for the Azure AD Graph API to query the directory data as you build your application.\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] The Graph Explorer does not support writing or deleting the data from a directory. You can only perform read operations on your Azure AD directory with the Graph Explorer.\n\nThe following is the output you would see if you were to navigate to the Graph Explorer, select Use Demo Company, and enter `https://graph.windows.net/GraphDir1.OnMicrosoft.com/users?api-version=1.5` to display all of the users in the demo directory:\n\n![Azure AD graph api explorer](./media/active-directory-graph-api-quickstart/screen_shot.jpg)\n\n**Load the Graph Explorer**: To load the tool, navigate to [https://graphexplorer.cloudapp.net/](https://graphexplorer.cloudapp.net/). Click **Use Demo Company** to run the Graph Explorer against data from a sample tenant. You do not need credentials to use the demo company. Alternatively, you can click **Sign in** and sign in with your Azure AD account credentials to run the Graph Explorer against your tenant. If you run Graph Explorer against your own tenant, either you or your administrator will need to consent during sign-in. If you have an Office 365 subscription, you automatically have an Azure AD tenant. The credentials you use to sign in to Office 365 are, in fact, Azure AD accounts, and you can use these credentials with Graph Explorer.\n\n**Run a query**: To run a query, type your query in the request text box and click **GET** or click the **enter** key. The results are displayed in the response box. For example, `https://graph.windows.net/graphdir1.onmicrosoft.com /groups?api-version=1.5` will list all group objects in the demo directory.\n\nNote the following features and limitations of the Graph Explorer:\n- Autocomplete capability on resource sets. To see this, click **Use Demo Company** and then click on the request text box (where the company URL appears). You can select a resource set from the dropdown list.\n\n- Supports the “me” and “myorganization” addressing aliases. For example, you can use `https://graph.windows.net/me?api-version=1.5` to return the user object of the signed-in user or `https://graph.windows.net/myorganization/users?api-version=1.5` to return all users in the current directory. Note that using the “me” alias returns an error for the demo company because there is no signed-in user making the request.\n\n- A response headers section. This can be used to help troubleshoot issues that occur when running queries.\n\n- A JSON viewer for the response with expand and collapse capabilities.\n\n- No support for displaying a thumbnail photo.\n\n## Using Fiddler to write to the directory\n\nFor the purposes of this Quickstart guide, you can use the Fiddler Web Debugger in order to practice performing ‘write’ operations against you Azure AD directory. For more information and to install Fiddler, see [http://www.telerik.com/fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler).\n\nIn the example below, you will use Fiddler Web Debugger to create a new security group ‘MyTestGroup’ in your Azure AD directory.\n\n**Obtain an access token**: To access Azure AD Graph, clients are required to successfully authenticate to Azure AD first. For more information, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](active-directory-authentication-scenarios.md).\n\n**Compose and run a query**: Complete the following steps.\n\n1. Open Fiddler Web Debugger and switch to the **Composer** tab.\n2. Since you want to create a new security group, select **Post** as the HTTP method from the pull-down menu. For more information about operations and permissions on a group object, see [Group](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974486.aspx) within the [Azure AD Graph REST API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/api/api-catalog).\n3. In the field next to **Post**, type in the following as the request URL: `https://graph.windows.net/mytenantdomain/groups?api-version=1.5`.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] You must substitute mytenantdomain with the domain name of your own Azure AD directory.\n\n4. In the field directly below Post pull-down, type the following:\n\n    ```\nHost: graph.windows.net\nAuthorization: your access token\nContent-Type: application/json\n```\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] Substitute your &lt;your access token&gt; with the access token for your Azure AD directory.\n\n5. In the **Request body** field, type the following:\n\n    ```\n        {\n            \"displayName\":\"MyTestGroup\",\n            \"mailNickname\":\"MyTestGroup\",\n            \"mailEnabled\":\"false\",\n            \"securityEnabled\": true\n        }\n```\n\n    For more information about creating groups, see [Create Group](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn151614.aspx).\n\nFor more information on Azure AD entities and types that are exposed by Graph and information about the operations that can be performed on them with Graph, see [Azure AD Graph REST API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/api/api-catalog).\n\n## Next steps\n\nLearn more about the [Azure AD Graph API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/api/api-catalog)\n\ntest\n"
