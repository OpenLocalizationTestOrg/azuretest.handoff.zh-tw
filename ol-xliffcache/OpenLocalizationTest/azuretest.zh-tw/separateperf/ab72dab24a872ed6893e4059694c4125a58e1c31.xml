(The list of jobs and corresponding information appears in the **Results** pane.) Additionally, you can right-click a listed job and see a context menu that lists available actions.\n\n## View scheduled jobs\n\nUse the following procedure to view scheduled backup jobs.\n\n#### To view scheduled jobs\n\n1. Click the desktop icon to start StorSimple Snapshot Manager. \n\n2. In the **Scope** pane, expand the **Jobs** node, and click **Scheduled**. The following information appears in the **Results** pane:\n\n    - **Name** – the name of the scheduled snapshot\n\n    - **Next Run** – the date and time of the next scheduled snapshot\n\n    - **Last Run** – the date and time of the most recent scheduled snapshot\n\n    >[AZURE.NOTE] For one-time only snapshots, the **Next Run** and **Last Run** will be the same. \n \n    ![Scheduled backup jobs](./media/storsimple-snapshot-manager-manage-backup-jobs/HCS_SSM_Jobs_scheduled.png) \n \n3.

Click the desktop icon to start StorSimple Snapshot Manager.\n\n2. In the **Scope** pane, expand the **Jobs** node, and click **Last 24 hours**. The **Results** pane shows backup jobs for the last 24 hours (to a maximum of 64 jobs). The following information appears in the **Results** pane, depending on the **View** options you specify:\n\n    - **Name** – the name of the scheduled snapshot.\n \n    - **Started** – the date and time when the snapshot began.\n\n    - **Stopped** – the date and time when the snapshot finished or was terminated.\n\n    - **Elapsed** – the amount of time between the **Started** and **Stopped** times.\n\n    - **Status** – the state of the recently completed job. **Success** indicates that the backup was created successfully. **Failed** indicates that the job did not run successfully.\n\n    - **Information** – the reason for the failure.\n\n    - **Bytes processed (MB)** – the amount of data from the volume group that was processed (in MBs). \n\n    ![Jobs that ran in the last 24 hours](./media/storsimple-snapshot-manager-manage-backup-jobs/HCS_SSM_Jobs_Last_24_hours.png) \n\n3.
