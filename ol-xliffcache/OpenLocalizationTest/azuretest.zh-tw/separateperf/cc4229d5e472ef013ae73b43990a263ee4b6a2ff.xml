Or maybe you'd like an email alert on events with specific properties? Continuous Export is ideal for this. The events you see in the Application Insights portal can be exported to storage in Microsoft Azure in JSON format. From there you can download your data and write whatever code you need to process it.  \n\nContinuous Export is available in the free trial period and on the [Standard and Premium pricing plans](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/application-insights/).\n\n(If you just want to do a [one-off export](app-insights-metrics-explorer.md#export-to-excel) of what you see on a metrics or search blade, click Export at the top of the blade.)\n\n## <a name=\"setup\"></a> Set up Continuous Export\n\nOn your application's Overview blade in the Application Insights portal, open Continuous Export: \n\n![Scroll down and click Continuous Export](./media/app-insights-export-telemetry/01-export.png)\n\nAdd an export, and choose an [Azure storage account](../storage-introduction.md) where you want to put the data:\n\n![Click Add, Export Destination, Storage account, and then either create a new store or choose an existing store](./media/app-insights-export-telemetry/02-add.png)\n\nChoose the event types you'd like to export:\n\n![Click Choose event types](./media/app-insights-export-telemetry/03-types.png)\n\n\nOnce you've created your export, it starts going. (You only get data that arrives after you create the export.) \n\nThere can be a delay of about an hour before data appears in the blob.\n\nIf you want to change the event types later, just edit the export:\n\n![Click Choose event types](./media/app-insights-export-telemetry/05-edit.png)\n\nTo stop the stream, click Disable. When you click Enable again, the stream will restart with new data. You won't get the data that arrived in the portal while export was disabled.\n\nTo stop the stream permanently, delete the export. Doing so doesn't delete your data from storage.\n\n#### Can't add or change an export?\n\n* To add or change exports, you need Owner, Contributor or Application Insights Contributor access rights. [Learn about roles][roles].\n\n## <a name=\"analyze\"></a> What events do you get?\n\nThe exported data is the raw telemetry we receive from your application, except that we add location data which we calculate from the client IP address. \n\nOther calculated metrics are not included. For example, we don't export average CPU utilisation, but we do export the raw telemetry from which the average is computed.\n\nThe data also includes the results of any [availability web tests](app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability.md) you have set up. \n\n## <a name=\"get\"></a> Inspect the data\n\nTo inspect Azure storage in Visual Studio, open **View**, **Cloud Explorer**. (If you don't have that menu command, you need to install the Azure SDK: Open the **New Project** dialog, expand Visual C#/Cloud and choose **Get Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET**.)\n\nWhen you open your blob store, you'll see a container with a set of blob files. The URI of each file derived from your Application Insights resource name, its instrumentation key, telemetry-type/date/time. (The resource name is all lowercase, and the instrumentation key omits dashes.)\n\n![Inspect the blob store with a suitable tool](./media/app-insights-export-telemetry/04-data.png)\n\nThe date and time are UTC and are when the telemetry was deposited in the store - not the time it was generated. So if you write code to download the data, it can move linearly through the data.\n\n\n## <a name=\"format\"></a> Data format\n\n* Each blob is a text file that contains multiple '\\n'-separated rows.\n* Each row is an unformatted JSON document. If you want to sit and stare at it, open it in Visual Studio and choose Edit, Advanced, Format File:\n\n![View the telemetry with a suitable tool](./media/app-insights-export-telemetry/06-json.png)\n\nTime durations are in ticks, where 10 000 ticks = 1ms. For example, these values show a time of 10ms to send a request from the browser, 30ms to receive it, and 1.8s to process the page in the browser:\n\n    \"sendRequest\": {\"value\": 10000.0},\n    \"receiveRequest\": {\"value\": 30000.0},\n    \"clientProcess\": {\"value\": 17970000.0}\n\n[Detailed data model reference for the property types and values.](app-insights-export-data-model.md)\n\n## Processing the data\n\nOn a small scale, you can write some code to pull apart your data, read it into a spreadsheet, and so on. For example:\n\n    private IEnumerable<T> DeserializeMany<T>(string folderName)\n    {\n      var files = Directory.EnumerateFiles(folderName, \"*.blob\", SearchOption.AllDirectories);\n      foreach (var file in files)\n      {\n         using (var fileReader = File.OpenText(file))\n         {\n            string fileContent = fileReader.ReadToEnd();\n            IEnumerable<string> entities = fileContent.Split('\\n').Where(s => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(s));\n            foreach (var entity in entities)\n            {\n                yield return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(entity);\n            }\n         }\n      }\n    }\n\nFor a larger code sample, see [using a worker role][exportasa].\n\n\n\n## <a name=\"delete\"></a>Delete your old data\nPlease note that you are responsible for managing your storage capacity and deleting the old data if necessary. \n\n## If you regenerate your storage key...\n\nIf you change the key to your storage, continuous export will stop working. You'll see a notification in your Azure account. \n\nOpen the Continuous Export blade and edit your export. Edit the Export Destination, but just leave the same storage selected. Click OK to confirm.\n\n![Edit the continuous export, open and close thee export destination.](./media/app-insights-export-telemetry/07-resetstore.png)\n\nThe continuous export will restart.\n\n## Export to Power BI\n\n[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) presents your data in rich and varied visuals, with the ability to bring together information from multiple sources. You can stream telemetry data about the performance and usage of your apps from Application Insights to Power BI.\n\n[Stream Application Insights to Power BI](app-insights-export-power-bi.md)\n\n![Sample of Power BI view of Application Insights usage data](./media/app-insights-export-telemetry/210.png)\n\n## Export to SQL\n\nAnother option is to move the data to a SQL database, where you can perform more powerful analytics.\n\nWe have samples showing two alternative methods of moving the data from the blob storage to a database:\n\n* [Export to SQL using a worker role][exportcode]\n* [Export to SQL using Stream Analytics][exportasa]\n\n\nOn larger scales, consider [HDInsight](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) - Hadoop clusters in the cloud. HDInsight provides a variety of technologies for managing and analyzing big data.\n\n\n\n## Q & A\n\n* *But all I want is a one-time download of a chart.*  \n \n    Yes, you can do that. At the top of the blade, click [Export Data](app-insights-metrics-explorer.md#export-to-excel).\n\n* *I set up an export, but there's no data in my store.*\n\n    Did Application Insights receive any telemetry from your app since you set up the export? You'll only receive new data.\n\n* *I tried to set up an export, but was denied access*\n\n    If the account is owned by your organization, you have to be a member of the owners or contributors groups.\n\n    <!-- Your account has to be either a paid-for account, or in the free trial period. -->\n\n* *Can I export straight to my own on-premises store?* \n\n    No, sorry. Our export engine currently only works with Azure storage at this time.  \n\n* *Is there any limit to the amount of data you put in my store?* \n\n    No. We'll keep pushing data in until you delete the export. We'll stop if we hit the outer limits for blob storage, but that's pretty huge. It's up to you to control how much storage you use.  \n\n* *How many blobs should I see in the storage?*\n\n * For every data type you selected to export, a new blob is created every minute (if data is available). \n * In addition, for applications with high traffic, additional partition units are allocated. In this case each unit creates a blob every minute.\n\n\n* *I regenerated the key to my storage or changed the name of the container, and now the export doesn't work.*\n\n    Edit the export and open the export destination blade. Leave the same storage selected as before, and click OK to confirm. Export will restart. If the change was within the past few days, you won't lose data.\n\n* *Can I pause the export?*\n\n    Yes. Click Disable.\n\n## Code samples\n\n* [Stream Application Insights to Power BI](app-insights-export-power-bi.md)\n* [Parse exported JSON using a worker role][exportcode]\n* [Export to SQL using Stream Analytics][exportasa]\n\n* [Detailed data model reference for the property types and values.](app-insights-export-data-model.md)\n\n<!--Link references-->\n\n[exportcode]: app-insights-code-sample-export-telemetry-sql-database.md\n[exportasa]: app-insights-code-sample-export-sql-stream-analytics.md\n[roles]: app-insights-resources-roles-access-control.md\n\n \n\ntest\n"
