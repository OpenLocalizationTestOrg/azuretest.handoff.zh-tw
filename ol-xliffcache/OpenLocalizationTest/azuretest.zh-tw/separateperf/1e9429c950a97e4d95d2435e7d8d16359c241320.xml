In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple *To do list* app in HTML and JavaScript that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you create uses the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio for server-side business logic and to manage the mobile service. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in JavaScript, see the JavaScript version of this topic.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-universal-get-started](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-universal-get-started.md)]\n\n##Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need the following:\n\n* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started%2F).\n* <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio Professional 2013</a>. A free trial version is available.\n\n\n## Create a new mobile service\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]\n\n## Create a new universal Windows app\n\nOnce you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Management Portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service.\n\nIn this section you will create a new universal Windows app that is connected to your mobile service.\n\n1. In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.\n\n2. In the quickstart tab, click **Windows** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Windows Store app**.\n\n    ![][6]\n\n    This displays the three easy steps to create a Windows Store app connected to your mobile service.\n\n    ![][7]\n\n3. If you haven't already done so, download and install <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio Professional 2013</a> on your local computer or virtual machine.\n\n4. Under **Download and run your app and service locally**, select a language for your Windows Store app, then click **Download**.\n\n    This downloads a solution contains projects for both the mobile service and for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.\n\n\n## Test the app against the local mobile service\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service-dotnet](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service-dotnet.md)]\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]You can review the code that accesses your mobile service to query and insert data, which is found in the default.js file.\n\n## Publish your mobile service\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service.md)]\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In the Shared code project, open the default.js file, locate the code that creates a [WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj554219.aspx) instance, comment-out the code that creates this client using *localhost* and uncomment the code that creates the client using the remote mobile service URL, which looks like the following:\n\n    var client = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient(\n        \"https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/\",\n        \"XXXXXX-APPLICATION-KEY-XXXXXX\"\n    );\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;The client will now access the mobile service published to Azure.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Press the **F5** key to rebuild the project and start the app.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;6. In the app, type meaningful text, such as *Complete the tutorial*, in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;This sends a POST request to the new mobile service hosted in Azure.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;7. (Optional) In a universal Windows solution, change the default start up project to the other app and press **F5** again and notice that data saved from the previous step is loaded from the mobile service after the app starts.\n\nFor more information about universal Windows apps, see [Supporting multiple device platforms from a single mobile service](mobile-services-how-to-use-multiple-clients-single-service.md#shared-vs).\n\n<!-- Anchors. -->\n[Getting started with Mobile Services]:#getting-started\n[Create a new mobile service]:#create-new-service\n[Define the mobile service instance]:#define-mobile-service-instance\n[Next Steps]:#next-steps\n\n<!-- Images. -->\n[0]: ./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started/mobile-quickstart-completed.png\n\n[6]: ./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started/mobile-portal-quickstart.png\n[7]: ./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started/mobile-quickstart-steps.png\n[8]: ./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started/mobile-service-startup.png\n\n[10]: ./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started/mobile-quickstart-startup.png\n[11]: ./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started/mobile-quickstart-publish.png\n[12]: ./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started/mobile-data-browse.png\n\n\n<!-- URLs. -->\n[Get started with data]: ../mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-universal-javascript-get-started-data.md\n[Get started with authentication]: ../mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started-users.md\n[Get started with push notifications]: ../mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started-push.md\n[Visual Studio Professional 2013]: https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546\n[Mobile Services SDK]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=257545\n[JavaScript and HTML]: mobile-services-win8-javascript/\n[Management Portal]: https://manage.windowsazure.com/\n[JavaScript version]: ../mobile-services-windows-store-get-started.md\n[Get started with data in Mobile Services using Visual Studio 2012]: ../mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-data-vs2012.md\n \ntest\n"
