This topic describes how to:\n\n- Inject data into an Azure virtual machine when it is being provisioned.\n\n- Retrieve it for both Windows and Linux.\n\n- Use special tools available on some systems to detect and handle custom data automatically.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] This article describes how custom data can be injected by using a VM created with the Azure Service Management API. To see how to use the Azure Resource Management API, see [the example template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-customdata).\n\n## Injecting custom data into your Azure virtual machine\n\nThis feature is currently supported only in the [Azure Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli). Although you may use any of the options for the `azure vm create` command, the following demonstrates one very basic approach.\n\n```\n    PASSWORD='AcceptablePassword -- more than 8 chars, a cap, a num, a special'\n    VMNAME=mycustomdataubuntu\n    USERNAME=username\n    VMIMAGE= An image chosen from among those listed by azure vm image list\n    azure vm create $VMNAME $VMIMAGE $USERNAME $PASSWORD --location \"West US\" --json -d ./custom-data.txt -e 22\n```\n\n\n## Using custom data in the virtual machine\n\n+ If your Azure virtual machine is a Windows-based virtual machine, then the custom data file is saved to `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\\AzureData\\CustomData.bin`. Although it was base64-encoded to transfer from the local computer to the new virtual machine, it is automatically decoded and can be opened or used immediately.\n\n   > [AZURE.NOTE] If the file exists, it is overwritten. The security on the directory is set to **System:Full Control** and **Administrators:Full Control**.\n\n+ If your Azure virtual machine is a Linux-based virtual machine, then the custom data file will be located in the following two places. The data will be base64-encoded, so you will need to decode the data first.\n\n    + At `/var/lib/waagent/ovf-env.xml`\n    + At `/var/lib/waagent/CustomData`\n\n\n\n## Cloud-init on Azure\n\nIf your Azure virtual machine is from an Ubuntu or CoreOS image, then you can use CustomData to send a cloud-config to cloud-init. Or if your custom data file is a script, then cloud-init can simply execute it.\n\n### Ubuntu Cloud Images\n\nIn most Azure Linux images, you would edit \"/etc/waagent.conf\" to configure the temporary resource disk and swap file. See [Azure Linux Agent user guide](virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide.md) for more information.\n\nHowever, on the Ubuntu Cloud Images, you must use cloud-init to configure the resource disk (that is, the \"ephemeral\" disk) and swap partition. See the following page on the Ubuntu wiki for more details: [AzureSwapPartitions](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AzureSwapPartitions).\n\n\n\n<!--Every topic should have next steps and links to the next logical set of content to keep the customer engaged-->\n## Next steps: Using cloud-init\n\nFor further information, see the [cloud-init documentation for Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit).\n\n<!--Link references-->\n[Add Role Service Management REST API Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj157186.aspx)\n\n[Azure Command-line Interface](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools-xplat)\n"
