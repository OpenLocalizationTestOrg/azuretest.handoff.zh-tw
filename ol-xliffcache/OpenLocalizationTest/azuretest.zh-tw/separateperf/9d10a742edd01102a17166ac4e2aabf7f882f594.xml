If you think you can solve a problem using CTAS then that is generally the best way to approach it - even if you are writing more data as a result.\n\nScenarios that can be worked around with CTAS include:\n\n- SELECT..INTO\n- ANSI JOINS on UPDATEs \n- ANSI JOINs on DELETEs\n- MERGE statement\n\nThis document also includes some best practices for when coding with CTAS.\n\n## SELECT..INTO\nYou may find SELECT..INTO appears in a number of places in your solution. \n\nAn SELECT..INTO example is below:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nINTO    #tmp_fct\nFROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]\n```\n\nTo convert this to CTAS is quite straight-forward:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE #tmp_fct\nWITH\n(\n    DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN\n,   LOCATION = USER_DB\n)\nAS\nSELECT  *\nFROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]\n;\n```\n\nUsing CTAS means you can also specify a data distribution preference and optional index the table as well.\n\n## ANSI join replacement for update statements\n\nYou may find you have a complex update that joins more than two tables together using ANSI joining syntax to perform the UPDATE or DELETE.\n\nImagine you had to update this table:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE [dbo].[AnnualCategorySales]\n(   [EnglishProductCategoryName]    NVARCHAR(50)    NOT NULL\n,   [CalendarYear]                  SMALLINT        NOT NULL\n,   [TotalSalesAmount]              MONEY           NOT NULL\n)\nWITH\n(\n    DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN\n)\n;\n```\n\nThe original query might have looked something like this:\n\n```\nUPDATE  acs\nSET     [TotalSalesAmount] = [fis].[TotalSalesAmount]\nFROM    [dbo].[AnnualCategorySales]     AS acs\nJOIN    (\n        SELECT  [EnglishProductCategoryName]\n        ,       [CalendarYear]\n        ,       SUM([SalesAmount])              AS [TotalSalesAmount]\n        FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]       AS s\n        JOIN    [dbo].[DimDate]                 AS d    ON s.[OrderDateKey]             = d.[DateKey]\n        JOIN    [dbo].[DimProduct]              AS p    ON s.[ProductKey]               = p.[ProductKey]\n        JOIN    [dbo].[DimProductSubCategory]   AS u    ON p.[ProductSubcategoryKey]    = u.[ProductSubcategoryKey]\n        JOIN    [dbo].[DimProductCategory]      AS c    ON u.[ProductCategoryKey]       = c.[ProductCategoryKey]\n        WHERE   [CalendarYear] = 2004\n        GROUP BY\n                [EnglishProductCategoryName]\n        ,       [CalendarYear]\n        ) AS fis\nON  [acs].[EnglishProductCategoryName]  = [fis].[EnglishProductCategoryName]\nAND [acs].[CalendarYear]                = [fis].[CalendarYear]\n;\n```\n\nAs SQL Data Warehouse does not support ANSI joins you cannot copy this code over without changing it slightly.\n\nYou can use a combination of a CTAS and an implicit join to replace this code:\n\n```\n-- Create an interim table\nCREATE TABLE CTAS_acs\nWITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)\nAS\nSELECT  ISNULL(CAST([EnglishProductCategoryName] AS NVARCHAR(50)),0)    AS [EnglishProductCategoryName]\n,       ISNULL(CAST([CalendarYear] AS SMALLINT),0)                      AS [CalendarYear]\n,       ISNULL(CAST(SUM([SalesAmount]) AS MONEY),0)                     AS [TotalSalesAmount]\nFROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]       AS s\nJOIN    [dbo].[DimDate]                 AS d    ON s.[OrderDateKey]             = d.[DateKey]\nJOIN    [dbo].[DimProduct]              AS p    ON s.[ProductKey]               = p.[ProductKey]\nJOIN    [dbo].[DimProductSubCategory]   AS u    ON p.[ProductSubcategoryKey]    = u.[ProductSubcategoryKey]\nJOIN    [dbo].[DimProductCategory]      AS c    ON u.[ProductCategoryKey]       = c.[ProductCategoryKey]\nWHERE   [CalendarYear] = 2004\nGROUP BY\n        [EnglishProductCategoryName]\n,       [CalendarYear]\n;\n\n-- Use an implicit join to perform the update \nUPDATE  AnnualCategorySales\nSET     AnnualCategorySales.TotalSalesAmount = CTAS_ACS.TotalSalesAmount\nFROM    CTAS_acs\nWHERE   CTAS_acs.[EnglishProductCategoryName] = AnnualCategorySales.[EnglishProductCategoryName]\nAND     CTAS_acs.[CalendarYear]               = AnnualCategorySales.[CalendarYear]\n;\n\n--Drop the interim table\nDROP TABLE CTAS_acs\n;\n```\n\n## ANSI join replacement for delete statements\nSometimes the best approach for deleting data is to use CTAS. Rather than deleting the data simply select the data you want to keep. This especially true for DELETE statements that use ansi joining syntax as this is not supported on SQL Data Warehouse.\n\nAn example of a converted DELETE statement is available below:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE dbo.DimProduct_upsert\nWITH \n(   Distribution=HASH(ProductKey)\n,   CLUSTERED INDEX (ProductKey)\n)\nAS -- Select Data you wish to keep\nSELECT     p.ProductKey\n,          p.EnglishProductName\n,          p.Color\nFROM       dbo.DimProduct p \nRIGHT JOIN dbo.stg_DimProduct s \nON         p.ProductKey = s.ProductKey\n;\n\nRENAME OBJECT dbo.DimProduct        TO DimProduct_old;\nRENAME OBJECT dbo.DimProduct_upsert TO DimProduct;\n```\n\n## Replace merge statements\nMerge statements can be replaced, at least in part, by using CTAS. You can consolidate the `INSERT` and the `UPDATE` into a single statement. Any deleted records would need to be closed off in a second statement.\n\nAn example of an `UPSERT` is available below:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE dbo.[DimProduct_upsert]\nWITH \n(   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])\n,   CLUSTERED INDEX ([ProductKey])\n)\nAS \n-- New rows and new versions of rows\nSELECT      s.[ProductKey]\n,           s.[EnglishProductName]\n,           s.[Color]\nFROM      dbo.[stg_DimProduct] AS s\nUNION ALL  \n-- Keep rows that are not being touched\nSELECT      p.[ProductKey]\n,           p.[EnglishProductName]\n,           p.[Color]\nFROM      dbo.[DimProduct] AS p\nWHERE NOT EXISTS\n(   SELECT  *\n    FROM    [dbo].[stg_DimProduct] s\n    WHERE   s.[ProductKey] = p.[ProductKey]\n)\n;\n\nRENAME OBJECT dbo.[DimProduct]          TO [DimProduct_old];\nRENAME OBJECT dbo.[DimpProduct_upsert]  TO [DimProduct];\n\n```\n\n## CTAS recommendation: Explicitly state data type and nullability of output\n\nWhen migrating code you might find you run across this type of coding pattern:\n\n```\nDECLARE @d decimal(7,2) = 85.455\n,       @f float(24)    = 85.455\n\nCREATE TABLE result\n(result DECIMAL(7,2) NOT NULL\n)\nWITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)\n\nINSERT INTO result\nSELECT @d*@f \n;\n```\n\nInstinctively you might think you should migrate this code to a CTAS and you would be correct. However, their is a hidden issue here. \n\nThe following code does NOT yield the same result:\n\n```\nDECLARE @d decimal(7,2) = 85.455\n,       @f float(24)    = 85.455\n;\n\nCREATE TABLE ctas_r\nWITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)\nAS\nSELECT @d*@f as result\n;\n```\n\nNotice that the column \"result\" carries forward the data type and nullability values of the expression. This can lead to subtle variances in values if you aren't careful.\n\nTry the following as an example:\n\n```\nSELECT result,result*@d\nfrom result\n;\n\nSELECT result,result*@d\nfrom ctas_r\n;\n```\n\nThe value stored for result is different. As the persisted value in the result column is used in other expressions the error becomes even more significant.\n\n![][1]\n\nThis is particularly important for data migrations. Even though the second query is arguably more accurate there is a problem. The data would be different compared to the source system and that leads to questions of integrity in the migration. This is one of those rare cases where the \"wrong\" answer is actually the right one!\n\nThe reason we see this disparity between the two results is down to implicit type casting. In the first example the table defines the column definition. When the row is inserted an implicit type conversion occurs. In the second example there is no implicit type conversion as the expression defines data type of the column. Notice also that the column in the second example has been defined as a NULLable column whereas in the first example it has not. When the table was created in the first example column nullability was explicitly defined. In the second example it was just left to the expression and by default this would result in a NULL definition.  \n\nTo resolve these issues you must explicitly set the type conversion and nullability in the SELECT portion of the CTAS statement. You cannot set these properties in the create table part.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to fix the code:\n\n```\nDECLARE @d decimal(7,2) = 85.455\n,       @f float(24)    = 85.455\n\nCREATE TABLE ctas_r\nWITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)\nAS\nSELECT ISNULL(CAST(@d*@f AS DECIMAL(7,2)),0) as result\n```\n\nNote the following:\n- CAST or CONVERT could have been used\n- ISNULL is used to force NULLability not COALESCE\n- ISNULL is the outermost function\n- The second part of the ISNULL is a constant i.e. 0\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] For the nullability to be correctly set it is vital to use ISNULL and not COALESCE. COALESCE is not a deterministic function and so the result of the expression will always be NULLable. ISNULL is different. It is deterministic. Therefore when the second part of the ISNULL function is a constant or a literal then the resulting value will be NOT NULL. \n\nThis tip is not just useful for ensuring the integrity of your calculations. It is also important for table partition switching. Imagine you have this table defined as your fact:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Sales]\n(\n    [date]      INT     NOT NULL\n,   [product]   INT     NOT NULL\n,   [store]     INT     NOT NULL\n,   [quantity]  INT     NOT NULL\n,   [price]     MONEY   NOT NULL\n,   [amount]    MONEY   NOT NULL\n)\nWITH \n(   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([product])\n,   PARTITION   (   [date] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES\n                    (20000101,20010101,20020101\n                    ,20030101,20040101,20050101\n                    )\n                )\n) \n;\n```\n\nHowever, the value field is a calculated expression it is not part of the source data.\n\nTo create your partitioned dataset you might want to do this:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Sales_in]\nWITH    \n(   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([product])\n,   PARTITION   (   [date] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES\n                    (20000101,20010101\n                    )\n                )\n)\nAS\nSELECT\n    [date]    \n,   [product] \n,   [store] \n,   [quantity]\n,   [price]   \n,   [quantity]*[price]  AS [amount]\nFROM [stg].[source]\nOPTION (LABEL = 'CTAS : Partition IN table : Create')\n;\n```\n\nThe query would run perfectly fine. The problem comes when you try to perform the partition switch. The table definitions do not match. To make the table definitions match the CTAS needs to be modified.\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Sales_in]\nWITH    \n(   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([product])\n,   PARTITION   (   [date] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES\n                    (20000101,20010101\n                    )\n                )\n)\nAS\nSELECT\n    [date]    \n,   [product] \n,   [store] \n,   [quantity]\n,   [price]   \n,   ISNULL(CAST([quantity]*[price] AS MONEY),0) AS [amount]\nFROM [stg].[source]\nOPTION (LABEL = 'CTAS : Partition IN table : Create');\n```\n\nYou can see therefore that type consistency and maintaining nullability properties on a CTAS is a good engineering best practice. It helps to maintain integrity in your calculations and also ensures that partition switching is possible.\n\nPlease refer to MSDN for more information on using [CTAS][].
