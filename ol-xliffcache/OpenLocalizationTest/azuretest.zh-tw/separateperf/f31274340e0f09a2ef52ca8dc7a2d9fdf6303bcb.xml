Using Azure Automation, your manual, frequently-repeated, long-running, and error-prone tasks can be automated to increase reliability, efficiency, and time to value for your organization.\n\nAzure Automation provides a highly-reliable, highly-available workflow execution engine that scales to meet your needs. In Azure Automation, processes can be kicked off manually, by 3rd-party systems, or at scheduled intervals so that tasks happen exactly when needed.\n\nReduce operational overhead and free up IT and DevOps staff to focus on work that adds business value by moving your cloud management tasks to be run automatically by Azure Automation.\n\n\n## How can Azure Automation help manage Azure Web App?\n\nWeb App can be managed in Azure Automation by using the PowerShell cmdlets that are available in the [Azure PowerShell tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj156055.aspx). Azure Automation has these Web App PowerShell cmdlets available out of the box, so that you can perform all of your Web App management tasks within the service. You can also pair these cmdlets in Azure Automation with the cmdlets for other Azure services to automate complex tasks across Azure services and 3rd party systems.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you've learned the basics of Azure Automation and how it can be used to manage Azure Web App, follow these links to learn more about Azure Automation.\n\n* See the Azure Automation [Getting Started Tutorial](../automation-intro.md)\n \n\ntest\n"
