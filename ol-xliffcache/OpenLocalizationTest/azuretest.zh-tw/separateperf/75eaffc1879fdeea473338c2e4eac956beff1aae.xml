The Azure Storage Client Library for Xamarin is a preview library; note that it may change in the future.\n\nThis tutorial shows you how to use Azure Blob storage with a Xamarin Android application. To learn more about Azure Storage before diving into the code, see [Next steps](#next-steps) at the end of this document.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storage-create-account-include](../../includes/storage-create-account-include.md)]\n\n## Generate a Shared Access Signature\n\nWhen developing with the Azure Storage Client Library for Xamarin, you cannot authenticate access to an Azure Storage account using your account access keys. This is to prevent your account credentials from being distributed to users that may download your app. Instead, we encourage the use of shared access signatures (SAS), which won’t expose your account credentials.\n\nIn this guide, we'll use Azure PowerShell to generate a SAS token. Then we'll create a Xamarin app that uses the generated SAS.\n\nFirst, you’ll need to install Azure PowerShell. Check out [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md#Install) for instructions.\n\nNext, open Azure PowerShell and run the following commands. Remember to replace `ACCOUNT_NAME` and `ACCOUNT_KEY== ` with your storage account credentials. Replace `CONTAINER_NAME` with a name of your choosing.\n\n    PS C:\\> $context = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName \"ACCOUNT_NAME\" -StorageAccountKey \"ACCOUNT_KEY==\"\n    PS C:\\> New-AzureStorageContainer CONTAINER_NAME -Permission Off -Context $context\n    PS C:\\> $now = Get-Date\n    PS C:\\> New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Name CONTAINER_NAME -Permission rwdl -ExpiryTime $now.AddDays(1.0) -Context $context -FullUri\n\nThe shared access signature URI for the new container should be similar to the following:\n\n    https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/sascontainer?sv=2012-02-12&se=2013-04-13T00%3A12%3A08Z&sr=c&sp=wl&sig=t%2BbzU9%2B7ry4okULN9S0wst%2F8MCUhTjrHyV9rDNLSe8g%3Dsss\n\nThe shared access signature that you created on the container will be valid for the next day. The signature grants full permissions (*e.g.*, read, write, delete, and list) to blobs within the container.\n\nFor more information about shared access signatures, see the [SAS tutorial for .NET](storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-2.md).\n\n## Create a new Xamarin Application\n\nFor this tutorial, we'll be creating our Xamarin application in Visual Studio. Follow these steps to create the application:\n\n1. Download and install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/).\n2. Download and install [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/platform).\n3. Open Visual Studio, and select **File > New > Project > Android > Blank App(Android)**.\n4. Right-click your project in the Solution Explorer pane and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Then search for **Azure Storage** and install **Azure Storage 4.4.0-preview**.\n\nYou should now have an application that allows you to click a button and increment a counter.\n\n## Use the shared access signature to perform container operations\n\nNext, add code to perform a series of container operations using the SAS URI that you generated.\n\nFirst add the following **using** statements:\n\n    using System.IO;\n    using System.Text;\n    using System.Threading.Tasks;\n    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;\n\n\nNext, add a line for your SAS token. Replace the `\"SAS_URI\"` string with the SAS URI that you generated in Azure PowerShell. Then add a line for a call to the `UseContainerSAS` method that we’ll create below. Note that the **async** keyword has been added before the delegate.\n\n\n    public class MainActivity : Activity\n    {\n        int count = 1;\n        string sas = \"SAS_URI\";\n        protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)\n        {\n            base.OnCreate(bundle);\n\n            // Set our view from the \"main\" layout resource\n            SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main);\n\n            // Get our button from the layout resource, and attach an event to it\n            Button button = FindViewById<Button>(Resource.Id.MyButton);\n\n            button.Click += async delegate  {\n                button.Text = string.Format(\"{0} clicks!\", count++);\n                await UseContainerSAS(sas);\n            };\n     }\n\nAdd a new method, `UseContainerSAS`, under the `OnCreate` method.\n\n    static async Task UseContainerSAS(string sas)\n    {\n        //Try performing container operations with the SAS provided.\n\n        //Return a reference to the container using the SAS URI.\n        CloudBlobContainer container = new CloudBlobContainer(new Uri(sas));\n        string date = DateTime.Now.ToString();\n        try\n        {\n            //Write operation: write a new blob to the container.\n            CloudBlockBlob blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(\"sasblob_\" + date + \".txt\");\n\n            string blobContent = \"This blob was created with a shared access signature granting write permissions to the container. \";\n            MemoryStream msWrite = new\n            MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(blobContent));\n            msWrite.Position = 0;\n            using (msWrite)\n            {\n                await blob.UploadFromStreamAsync(msWrite);\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Write operation succeeded for SAS \" + sas);\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Write operation failed for SAS \" + sas);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Additional error information: \" + e.Message);\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n        try\n        {\n            //Read operation: Get a reference to one of the blobs in the container and read it.\n            CloudBlockBlob blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(\"sasblob_” + date + “.txt\");\n            string data = await blob.DownloadTextAsync();\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Read operation succeeded for SAS \" + sas);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Blob contents: \" + data);\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Additional error information: \" + e.Message);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Read operation failed for SAS \" + sas);\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n        Console.WriteLine();\n        try\n        {\n            //Delete operation: Delete a blob in the container.\n            CloudBlockBlob blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(\"sasblob_” + date + “.txt\");\n            await blob.DeleteAsync();\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Delete operation succeeded for SAS \" + sas);\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Delete operation failed for SAS \" + sas);\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Additional error information: \" + e.Message);\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n    }\n\n## Run the application\n\nYou can now run this application in an emulator or Android device.\n\nAlthough this getting started focused on Android, you can use the `UseContainerSAS` method in your iOS or Windows Store applications as well. Xamarin also allows developers to create Windows Phone apps; however, our library does not yet support this.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to use Azure Blob storage and SAS with a Xamarin application. As a further exercise, a similar pattern could be applied to generate a SAS token for an Azure table or queue.\n\nLearn more about blobs, tables, and queues by checking out the following links:\n\n[Introduction to Microsoft Azure Storage](storage-introduction.md)  \n[How to use Blob Storage from .NET](storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs.md)  \n[How to use Table Storage from .NET](storage-dotnet-how-to-use-tables.md)  \n[How to use Queue Storage from .NET](storage-dotnet-how-to-use-queues.md)\n "
