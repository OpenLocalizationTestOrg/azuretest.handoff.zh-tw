As can be seen from the example code above, no error catching is implemented, and the service assumes that all the variables are continuous/positive values and the frequency should be an integer greater than 1. The length of the date and value vectors should be the same. The date variable should adhere to the format ‘mm/dd/yyyy’.\n\n##FAQ\nFor frequently asked questions on consumption of the web service or publishing to marketplace, see [here](machine-learning-marketplace-faq.md).\n\n[1]: ./media/machine-learning-r-csharp-arima/arima-img1.png\n[2]: ./media/machine-learning-r-csharp-arima/arima-img2.png\n[3]: ./media/machine-learning-r-csharp-arima/arima-img3.png\n\n\n<!-- Module References -->\n[execute-r-script]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/30806023-392b-42e0-94d6-6b775a6e0fd5/\n \n\ntest\n"
