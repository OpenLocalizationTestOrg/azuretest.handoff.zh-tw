These API Apps are based on concepts and tools used within BizTalk Server, but are now available as part of Azure App Service. \n\nOne category of these API Apps are the Business-to-Business (B2B) API Apps. Using these B2B API Apps, you can easily add partners, create agreements, and do everything as you would on-premises using EDI, AS2, and EDIFACT.  \n\nThese B2B API Apps offer \"Trigger\" and \"Action\" capabilities. A Trigger starts a new instance based on a specific event, like the arrival of an X12 message from a partner. An Action is the result, like after receiving an X12 message, then send the message using AS2.\n\n\n## What is a Business-to-Business Connector or API Apps\nThe Business-to-Business (B2B) feature includes existing, pre-built API Apps that allow different companies, divisions, applications, and so on to communicate using AS2, EDI, and EDIFACT. \n\nThe B2B API Apps include: \n\nConnector or API Apps | Description\n--- | ---\nBizTalk Trading Partner Management | An API App that creates business-to-business (B2B) relationships using partners and agreements. These relationships utilize the AS2, EDIFACT, and X12 protocol.<br/><br/>The TPM API App is the base requirement of the AS2 connector, and the X12 or EDIFACT API Apps. \nAS2 Connector | A connector that receives and sends messages using the AS2 transport. The connector transports data securely and reliably over the Internet.\nBizTalk EDIFACT | An API App that receives and sends messages using EDIFACT. EDIFACT is also commonly referred to as UN/EDIFACT (United Nations/Electronic Data Interchange For Administration, Commerce and Transport) and is widely used across industries.\nBizTalk X12 | An API App that receives and sends messages using the X12 protocol. X12 is also commonly referred to as ASC X12 (Accredited Standards Committee X12) and is widely used across industries. \n\n\nUsing these API Apps, you can complete different EDI messaging tasks. For example, using the AS2 connector, you can securely receive and send different types of messages (EDI, XML, Flat-File, and so on) to a customer, a division within your company like Human Resources, or anyone that uses AS2. \n\nYou can create as many API Apps as you want and create them easily. You can also reuse a single API App within multiple scenarios or workflows.\n\nYou can do this without writing any code. Let's get started. \n\n\n## Requirements to Get Started\nWhen you create B2B API Apps, there are some required resources. These items must be created by you before they can be used within other API Apps. These requirements include: \n\nRequirement | Description\n--- | ---\nAzure SQL Database | Stores B2B items including partners, schemas, certificates, and agreeements. Each of the B2B API Apps requires its own Azure SQL Database. <br/><br/>**Note** Copy the connection string to this database.<br/><br/>[Create an Azure SQL Database](../sql-database-get-started.md)\nAzure Blob Storage container | Stores message properties when AS2 archiving is enabled. If you don't need AS2 message archiving, a Storage container is not needed. <br/><br/>**Note** If you are enabling archiving, copy the connection string to this Blob Storage.<br/><br/>[About Azure Storage Accounts](../storage-create-storage-account.md)\nService Bus Namespace and its Key values | Stores X12 and EDIFACT batching data. If you don't need batching, a Service Bus namespace is not needed.<br/><br/>**Note** If you are enabling batching, copy these values.<br/><br/>[Create a Service Bus Namespace](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh690931.aspx)\nTPM Instance | A BizTalk Trading Partner Management (TPM) instance is required to create an AS2 connector and X12 or EDIFACT API App. When you create the TPM API App, you are creating the TPM Instance. <br/><br/>**Note** Know the name of your TPM API App. \n\n\n## Create the API Apps\nB2B API Apps can be created using the Azure portal or using REST APIs. \n\n\n### Create the API Apps using REST APIs\n[See the documentation on how to use the REST APIs.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=529766)\n\n\n### Create the B2B API Apps in the Azure Portal\nIn the Azure portal, you can create B2B API Apps when creating Logic Apps, Web Apps, or Mobile Apps. Or, you can create one using its own blade. Both ways are easy so it depends on your needs or preferences. Some users prefer to create all the B2B API Apps with their specific properties first. Then, create the Logic Apps/Web Apps/Mobile Apps, and add the B2B API Apps you created.  \n\nThe following steps create the B2B API Apps using the API Apps blade.\n\n\n#### Create the BizTalk Trading Partner Management (TPM) API Apps\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] A BizTalk Trading Partner Management (TPM) instance is required to create an AS2 connector and X12 or EDIFACT API App. When you create the TPM API App, you are creating the TPM Instance.\n\nThe following steps create the TPM instance:\n\n1.
