All of your segments defined for your app show up on this list. **See also:** [UI Documentation -  Segments][Link 18]\n- **App Info:** Custom App Info Tags can be created from “Settings” to track user behavior. **See also:** [UI Documentation -  Settings][Link 20]\n\n## Example: \nIf you want to push an announcements only to the sub-set of your users that have performed an in-app purchase action.\n\n1. Go to your application settings page, select the \"App info\" menu and select \"New app ino\"\n2. Register a new Boolean app info called \"inAppPurchase\"\n3. Make your application set this app info to \"true\" when the user successfully perform an in-app purchase (by using the sendAppInfo(\"inAppPurchase\", ...) function)\n4. If you don't want to do this from your application, you can do it from your backend by using the device API)\n5.

Complex push configuration options (like updating badges) can also delay pushes. Using a \"one shot\" campaign from the Push API is the absolute fastest push method in Azure Mobile Engagement. Using only app info tags as push criteria for a Reach campaign (either from the Reach API or the UI) is the next fastest method since app info tags are stored on the server side. Using other targeting criteria for a push campaign is the most flexible but slowest push method since Azure Mobile Engagement has to query the devices in order to send the campaign.\n
