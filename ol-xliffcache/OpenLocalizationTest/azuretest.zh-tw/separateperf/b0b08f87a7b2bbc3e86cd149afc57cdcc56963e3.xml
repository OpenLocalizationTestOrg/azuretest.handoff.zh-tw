To integrate Reach campaigns in your application, please read first How to Integrate Engagement Reach on Android.\n\n##Introduction\n\nIntegrating ADM allows your application to be pushed even when it's not running.\n\nNo campaign data is actually sent via ADM, it's just a background signal telling the application to fetch the Engagement push. If the application is not running while receiving an ADM push, it triggers a connection to the Engagement servers to fetch the push, the Engagement connection remains active for about a minute in case the user launches the application in the response to the push.\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Only Amazon Kindle devices running Android 4.0.3 or above are supported by Amazon Device Messaging; however, you can integrate this code safely on other devices. If the application cannot be woken up by ADM, the Engagement notification will be received the next time the application is launched.\n\n##Sign up to ADM\n\nIf not already done, you must enable ADM on your Amazon account.\n\nThe procedure is detailed at: [<https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm/credentials.html>].\n\nUpon completing the procedure, you get:\n\n-   OAuth credentials (a Client ID and a Client Secret) for Engagement to be able to push your devices.\n-   An API Key that must be integrated into your application.\n\n##SDK integration\n\n### Managing device registrations\n\nEach device must send a registration command to the ADM servers, otherwise they can't be reached.\n\nIf you already use the [ADM client library], and already have [integrated ADM] you can directly go to android-sdk-adm-receive.\n\nIf you have not integrated ADM yet, Engagement has a simpler way to enable it in your application:\n\nEdit your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:\n\n-   Add the Amazon namespace, the file should begin like this:\n\n        <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n        <manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n                  xmlns:amazon=\"http://schemas.amazon.com/apk/res/android\"\n\n-   Inside the `<application/>` tag, add this section:\n\n        <amazon:enable-feature\n           android:name=\"com.amazon.device.messaging\"\n           android:required=\"false\"/>\n        \n        <meta-data android:name=\"engagement:adm:register\" android:value=\"true\" />\n\n-   After adding the amazon tag, you may have a build error if your Project Build Target is below Android 2.1. You have to use an **Android 2.1+** build target (don't worry, you can still have a `minSdkVersion` set to 4).\n-   Integrate the ADM API Key as an asset by following [this procedure].\n\nThen follow the instructions of the next sections.\n\n### Communicate registration id to the Engagement Push service and receive notifications\n\nIn order to communicate the registration id of the device to the Engagement Push service and receive its notifications, add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, inside the `<application/>` tag (even if you use ADM without Engagement):\n\n        <receiver android:name=\"com.microsoft.azure.engagement.adm.EngagementADMEnabler\"\n          android:exported=\"false\">\n          <intent-filter>\n            <action android:name=\"com.microsoft.azure.engagement.intent.action.APPID_GOT\"/>\n          </intent-filter>\n        </receiver>\n        \n         <receiver android:name=\"com.microsoft.azure.engagement.adm.EngagementADMReceiver\"\n           android:permission=\"com.amazon.device.messaging.permission.SEND\">\n          <intent-filter>\n            <action android:name=\"com.amazon.device.messaging.intent.REGISTRATION\"/>\n            <action android:name=\"com.amazon.device.messaging.intent.RECEIVE\"/>\n            <category android:name=\"<your_package_name>\"/>\n          </intent-filter>\n        </receiver>   \n\nEnsure you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` (before the `</application>` tag).\n\n        <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WAKE_LOCK\"/>\n        <uses-permission android:name=\"com.amazon.device.messaging.permission.RECEIVE\"/>\n        <uses-permission android:name=\"<your_package_name>.permission.RECEIVE_ADM_MESSAGE\"/>\n        <permission android:name=\"<your_package_name>.permission.RECEIVE_ADM_MESSAGE\" android:protectionLevel=\"signature\"/>\n\n##Grant Engagement OAuth credentials\n\nSubmit your OAuth Credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) at $/\\#application/YOUR\\_APPID/native-push.\n\nYou can now select \"Any Time\" when creating Reach announcements and polls.\n\n\n[<https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm/credentials.html>]:https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm/credentials.html\n[ADM client library]:https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm/setup.html\n[integrated ADM]:https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm/integrating-app.html\n[this procedure]:https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm/integrating-app.html#Asset\n \ntest\n"
