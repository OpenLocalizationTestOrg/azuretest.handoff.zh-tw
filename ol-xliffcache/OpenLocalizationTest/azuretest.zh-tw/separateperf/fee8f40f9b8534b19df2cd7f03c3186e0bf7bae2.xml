You do that by adding the desired host name to the **vmName** attribute of the **Role** element. The value of the **vmName** attribute is used as a base for the host name of each role instance. For example, if **vmName** is *webrole* and there are three instances of that role, the host names of the instances will be *webrole0*, *webrole1*, and *webrole2*. You do not need to specify a host name for virtual machines in the configuration file, because the host name for a virtual machine is populated based on the virtual machine name.For more information about configuring a Microsoft Azure service, see [Azure Service Configuration Schema (.cscfg File)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee758710.aspx)\n\n## Viewing hostnames\n\nYou can view the host names of virtual machines and role instances in a cloud service by using various tools: Azure portal, service configuration file, Remote Desktop, and [Azure Service Management REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee460799.aspx).\n\n### Azure Portal\n\nYou can use the Azure portal to view the host names for virtual machines on the virtual machine dashboard page. Keep in mind that the dashboard shows a value for **Name** and **Host Name**. Although they are initially the same, changing the host name will not change the name of the virtual machine or role instance.\n\nRole instances can also be located in the Azure portal, but when you list the instances in a cloud service, the host name is not displayed. You will see a name for each instance, but that name does not represent the host name.\n\n### Service configuration file\n\nYou can download the service configuration file for a deployed service from the **Configure** page of the service in the Azure portal. You can then look for the **vmName** attribute for the **Role name** element to see the host name. Keep in mind that this host name is used as a base for the host name of each role instance. For example, if **vmName** is *webrole* and there are three instances of that role, the host names of the instances will be *webrole0*, *webrole1*, and *webrole2*.\n\n### Remote Desktop\n\nAfter you enable Remote Desktop (Windows), Windows PowerShell remoting (Windows), or SSH (Linux and Windows) connections to your virtual machines or role instances, you can view the host name from an active Remote Desktop connection in various ways:\n\n- Type hostname at the command prompt or SSH terminal.\n\n- Type ipconfig /all at the command prompt (Windows only).\n\n- View the computer name in the system settings (Windows only).\n\n### Azure Service Management REST API\n\nFrom a REST client, follow these instructions:\n\n1. Ensure that you have a client certificate to connect to the Azure portal. To obtain a client certificate, follow the steps presented in [How to: Download and Import Publish Settings and Subscription Information](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn385850(v=nav.70).aspx).\n\n1. Set a header entry named x-ms-version with a value of 2013-11-01.\n\n1. Send a request in the following format: https://management.core.windows.net/\\<subscrition-id\\>/services/hostedservices/\\<service-name\\>?embed-detail=true\n\n1. Look for the **HostName** element for each **RoleInstance** element.\n\n>[AZURE.WARNING] You can also view the internal domain suffix for your cloud service from the REST call response by checking the **InternalDnsSuffix** element, or by running ipconfig /all from a command prompt in a Remote Desktop session (Windows), or by running cat /etc/resolv.conf from an SSH terminal (Linux).\n\n## Modifying a hostname\n\nYou can modify the host name for any virtual machine or role instance by uploading a modified service configuration file, or by renaming the computer from a Remote Desktop session.\n\n## Next steps\n\n[Name Resolution (DNS)](virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md)\n\n[Azure Service Configuration Schema (.cscfg)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/ee758710.aspx)\n\n[Azure Virtual Network Configuration Schema)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248093)\n\n[Specify DNS settings using network configuration files](virtual-networks-specifying-a-dns-settings-in-a-virtual-network-configuration-file.md)\n"
