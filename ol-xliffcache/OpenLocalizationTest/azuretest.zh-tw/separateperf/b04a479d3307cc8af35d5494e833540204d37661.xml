But since you're reading this to get a better understanding of what's going on, we'll take you through the steps manually.\n\nYou'll need:\n\n* A subscription to [Microsoft Azure][azure].\n* Visual Studio 2013 or later.\n\n## 1. Create an Application Insights resource\n\nIn the [Azure portal][portal], create a new Application Insights resource.\n\n![Choose New, Developer Services, Application Insights](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/01-new.png)\n\nA [resource][roles] in Azure is an instance of a service. This resource is where telemetry from your app will be analyzed and presented to you.\n\n#### Copy the Instrumentation Key\n\nThe key identifies the resource. You'll need it to configure the SDK to send the data to the resource.\n\n![Open the Essentials drop-down drawer and select the instrumentation key](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/02-props.png)\n\n\n## 2. Add the Application Insights SDK to your apps\n\nIn Visual Studio, add the appropriate SDK to your project.\n\nIf it's a Windows Universal app, repeat the steps for both the Windows Phone project and the Windows project.\n\n1. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.\n\n    ![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/03-nuget.png)\n\n2. Search for \"Application Insights\".\n\n    ![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/04-ai-nuget.png)\n\n3. Choose **Application Insights for Windows Applications**\n\n4. Add an ApplicationInsights.config file to the root of your project and insert the instrumentation key copied from the portal. A sample xml for this config file is shown below.\n\n    ```xml\n        <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n        <ApplicationInsights>\n            <InstrumentationKey>YOUR COPIED INSTRUMENTATION KEY</InstrumentationKey>\n        </ApplicationInsights>\n    ```\n\n    Set the properties of the ApplicationInsights.config file: **Build Action** == **Content** and **Copy to Output Directory** == **Copy always**.\n\n    ![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/AIConfigFileSettings.png)\n\n5. Add the following initialization code. It is best to add this code to the `App()` constructor. If you do it somewhere else, you might miss auto collection of the first pageviews.  \n\n```C#\n    public App()\n    {\n       // Add this initilization line.\n       WindowsAppInitializer.InitializeAsync();\n\n       this.InitializeComponent();\n       this.Suspending += OnSuspending;\n    }  \n```\n\n**Windows Universal apps**: Repeat the steps for both the Phone and the Store project. [Example of a Windows 8.1 Universal app](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/Windows%208.1%20Universal).\n\n## <a name=\"network\"></a>3. Enable network access for your app\n\nIf your app doesn't already [request outgoing network access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh452752.aspx), you'll have to add that to its manifest as a [required capability](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211477.aspx).\n\n## <a name=\"run\"></a>4. Run your project\n\n[Run your application with F5](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/bg161304.aspx) and use it, so as to generate some telemetry.\n\nIn Visual Studio, you'll see a count of the events that have been received.\n\n![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-09eventcount.png)\n\nIn debug mode, telemetry is sent as soon as it's generated. In release mode, telemetry is stored on the device and sent only when the app resumes.\n\n\n## <a name=\"monitor\"></a>5. See monitor data\n\nOpen Application Insights from your project.\n\n![Right-click your project and open the Azure portal](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-04-openPortal.png)\n\n\nAt first, you'll just see one or two points. For example:\n\n![Click through to more data](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-26-devices-01.png)\n\nClick **Refresh** after a few seconds if you're expecting more data.\n\nClick any chart to see more detail.\n\n\n## <a name=\"deploy\"></a>5. Publish your application to Store\n\n[Publish your application](http://dev.windows.com/publish) and watch the data accumulate as users download and use it.\n\n## Customize your telemetry\n\n#### Choose the collectors\n\nApplication Insights SDK Includes several collectors, which collect different types of data from your app automatically. By default, they are all active. But you can choose which collectors to initialize in the app constructor:\n\n    WindowsAppInitializer.InitializeAsync( \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n       WindowsCollectors.Metadata\n       | WindowsCollectors.PageView\n       | WindowsCollectors.Session\n       | WindowsCollectors.UnhandledException);\n\n#### Send your own telemetry data\n\nUse the [API][api] to send events, metrics and diagnostic data to Application Insights. In summary:\n\n```C#\n\n var tc = new TelemetryClient(); // Call once per thread\n\n // Send a user action or goal:\n tc.TrackEvent(\"Win Game\");\n\n // Send a metric:\n tc.TrackMetric(\"Queue Length\", q.Length);\n\n // Provide properties by which you can filter events:\n var properties = new Dictionary{\"game\", game.Name};\n\n // Provide metrics associated with an event:\n var measurements = new Dictionary{\"score\", game.score};\n\n tc.TrackEvent(\"Win Game\", properties, measurements);\n\n```\n\nFor more details, see [Custom Events and Metrics][api].\n\n## What's next?\n\n* [Detect and diagnose crashes in your app][windowsCrash]\n* [Learn about metrics][metrics]\n* [Learn about diagnostic search][diagnostic]\n\n\n## <a name=\"ide\"></a>Automated setup\n\nIf you prefer to let Visual Studio perform the setup steps, you can do that with Windows Phone, Windows Store, and many other types of apps.\n\n### <a name=\"new\"></a>If you're creating a new Windows app project ...\n\nSelect **Application Insights** in the **New Project** dialog.\n\nIf you're asked to sign in, use the credentials for your Azure account (which is separate from your Visual Studio Online account).\n\n![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-d21-new.png)\n\n\n### <a name=\"existing\"></a>Or if it's an existing project ...\n\nAdd Application Insights from Solution Explorer.\n\n\n![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-d22-add.png)\n\n## Upgrade to a new release of the SDK\n\nWhen a [new SDK version is released](app-insights-release-notes-windows.md):\n* Right-click your project and choose Manage NuGet Packages.\n* Select the installed Application Insights packages and choose **Action: Upgrade**.\n\n\n## <a name=\"usage\"></a>Next Steps\n\n\n[Detect and diagnose crashes in your app][windowsCrash]\n\n[Capture and search diagnostic logs][diagnostic]\n\n\n[Track usage of your app][windowsUsage]\n\n[Use the API to send custom telemetry][api]\n\n[Troubleshooting][qna]\n\n\n\n<!--Link references-->\n\n[api]: app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md\n[azure]: ../insights-perf-analytics.md\n[diagnostic]: app-insights-diagnostic-search.md\n[metrics]: app-insights-metrics-explorer.md\n[portal]: http://portal.azure.com/\n[qna]: app-insights-troubleshoot-faq.md\n[roles]: app-insights-resources-roles-access-control.md\n[windowsCrash]: app-insights-windows-crashes.md\n[windowsUsage]: app-insights-windows-usage.md\n\ntest\n"
