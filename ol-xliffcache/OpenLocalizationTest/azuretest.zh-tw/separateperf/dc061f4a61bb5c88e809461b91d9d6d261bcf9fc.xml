Key Vault supports multiple key types and algorithms and can be used with hardware security modules (HSM) for high-value customer keys. In addition, you can use Key Vault to securely store secrets which are limited size octet objects with no specific semantics. A key vault can contain a mix of keys and secrets. Access control for the types of objects is independently managed.\n\nUsers, subject to successful authorization, can do the following:\n\n- Manage cryptographic keys using [Create](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903634.aspx), [Import](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903626.aspx), [Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903616.aspx), [Delete](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903611.aspx) and other operations\n\n- Manage secrets using [Get](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903633.aspx), [Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn986818.aspx, [Delete](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903613.aspx) and other operations\n\n- Use cryptographic keys with [Sign](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878096.aspx)/[Verify](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878082.aspx), [WrapKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878066.aspx)/[UnwrapKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878079.aspx) and [Encrypt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878060.aspx)/[Decrypt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878097.aspx) operations\n\nOperations against key vaults are authenticated and authorized by using Azure Active Directory.\n\n## Programming for Key Vault\n\nThe Key Vault management system for programmers consists of several interfaces, with REST as the foundation.\n\n### REST\n\nThe REST API is the foundation of all programmatic interaction with the Key Vault.\n\nKey Vault has its own REST endpoint which is described in the [Key Vault REST API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903609.aspx)\n\n### .NET\n\nThe .NET API is a set of wrappers that allows implementation through the C# programming model without needing to interact directly with the REST endpoint.
