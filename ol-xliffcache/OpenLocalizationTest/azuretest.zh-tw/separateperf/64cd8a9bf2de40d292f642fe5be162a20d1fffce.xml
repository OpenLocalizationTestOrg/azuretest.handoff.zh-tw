This common task discusses how to specify an HTTPS endpoint for a web role and how to upload an SSL certificate to secure your application.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The procedures in this task apply to Azure Cloud Services; for Websites, see [Configuring an SSL certificate for an Azure website](../web-sites-configure-ssl-certificate.md).\n\nThis task will use a production deployment; information on using a staging deployment is provided at the end of this topic.\n\nRead [this](cloud-services-how-to-create-deploy.md) first if you have not yet created a cloud service.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [websites-cloud-services-css-guided-walkthrough](../../includes/websites-cloud-services-css-guided-walkthrough.md)]\n\n\n## Step 1: Get an SSL certificate\n\nTo configure SSL for an application, you first need to get an SSL certificate that has been signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), a trusted third-party who issues certificates for this purpose. If you do not already have one, you will need to obtain one from a company that sells SSL certificates.\n\nThe certificate must meet the following requirements for SSL certificates in Azure:\n\n-   The certificate must contain a private key.\n-   The certificate must be created for key exchange, exportable to a Personal Information Exchange (.pfx) file.\n-   The certificate's subject name must match the domain used to access the cloud service. You cannot obtain an SSL certificate from a certificate authority (CA) for the cloudapp.net domain. You must acquire a custom domain name to use when access your service. When you request a certificate from a CA the certificate's subject name must match the custom domain name used to access your application. For example, if your custom domain name is **contoso.com** you would request a certificate from your CA for ***.contoso.com** or **www.contoso.com**.\n-   The certificate must use a minimum of 2048-bit encryption.\n\nFor test purposes, you can [create](cloud-services-certs-create.md) and use a self-signed certificate. A self-signed certificate is not authenticated through a CA and can use the cloudapp.net domain as the website URL. For example, the task below uses a self-signed certificate in which  the common name (CN) used in the certificate is **sslexample.cloudapp.net**.\n\nNext, you must include information about the certificate in your service definition and service configuration files.\n\n## Step 2: Modify the service definition and configuration files\n\nYour application must be configured to use the certificate, and an HTTPS endpoint must be added. As a result, the service definition and service configuration files need to be updated.\n\n1.  In your development environment, open the service definition file\n    (CSDEF), add a **Certificates** section within the **WebRole**\n    section, and include the following information about the\n    certificate:\n\n        <WebRole name=\"CertificateTesting\" vmsize=\"Small\">\n        ...\n            <Certificates>\n                <Certificate name=\"SampleCertificate\" \n                             storeLocation=\"LocalMachine\" \n                             storeName=\"CA\" />\n            </Certificates>\n        ...\n        </WebRole>\n\n    The **Certificates** section defines the name of our certificate, its location, and the name of the store where it is located. We have chosen to store the certificate in the CA (Certificate Authority)tore, but you can choose other options as well. See [How to associate a certificate with a service][] for more information.\n\n2.  In your service definition file, add an **InputEndpoint** element\n    within the **Endpoints** section to enable HTTPS:\n\n        <WebRole name=\"CertificateTesting\" vmsize=\"Small\">\n        ...\n            <Endpoints>\n                <InputEndpoint name=\"HttpsIn\" protocol=\"https\" port=\"443\" \n                    certificate=\"SampleCertificate\" />\n            </Endpoints>\n        ...\n        </WebRole>\n\n3.  In your service definition file, add a **Binding** element within\n    the **Sites** section. This adds an HTTPS binding to map the\n    endpoint to your site:\n\n        <WebRole name=\"CertificateTesting\" vmsize=\"Small\">\n        ...\n            <Sites>\n                <Site name=\"Web\">\n                    <Bindings>\n                        <Binding name=\"HttpsIn\" endpointName=\"HttpsIn\" />\n                    </Bindings>\n                </Site>\n            </Sites>\n        ...\n        </WebRole>\n\n    All of the required changes to the service definition file have been\n    completed, but you still need to add the certificate information to\n    the service configuration file.\n\n4.  In your service configuration file (CSCFG), ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg, add a **Certificates**\n    section within the **Role** section, replacing the sample thumbprint\n    value shown below with that of your certificate:\n\n        <Role name=\"Deployment\">\n        ...\n            <Certificates>\n                <Certificate name=\"SampleCertificate\" \n                    thumbprint=\"9427befa18ec6865a9ebdc79d4c38de50e6316ff\" \n                    thumbprintAlgorithm=\"sha1\" />\n            </Certificates>\n        ...\n        </Role>\n\n(The example above uses **sha1** for the thumbprint algorithm. Specify the appropriate value for your certificate's thumbprint algorithm.)\n\nNow that the service definition and service configuration files have\nbeen updated, package your deployment for uploading to Azure. If\nyou are using **cspack**, ensure that you don't use the\n**/generateConfigurationFile** flag, as that will overwrite the\ncertificate information you just inserted.\n\n## Step 3: Upload a certificate\n\nYour deployment package has been updated to use the certificate, and an\nHTTPS endpoint has been added. Now you can upload the package and\ncertificate to Azure with the Management Portal.\n\n1. Log into the [Azure Management Portal][]. \n2. Click on **Cloud Services** on the left-side navigation pane.\n3. Click on the desired cloud service.\n4. Click on the **Certificates** tab.\n\n    ![Click the Certificates tab](./media/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate/click-cert.png)\n\n5. Click the **Upload** button.\n\n    ![Upload](./media/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate/upload-button.png)\n    \n6. Provide the **File**, **Password**, then click **Complete** (the checkmark).\n\n## Step 4: Connect to the role instance by using HTTPS\n\nNow that your deployment is up and running in Azure, you can\nconnect to it using HTTPS.\n\n1.  In the Management Portal, select your deployment, then click the link under **Site URL**.\n\n    ![Determine site URL][2]\n\n2.  In your web browser, modify the link to use **https** instead of **http**, and then visit the page.\n\n    **Note:** If you are using a self-signed certificate, when you\n    browse to an HTTPS endpoint that's associated with the self-signed\n    certificate you will see a certificate error in the browser. Using a\n    certificate signed by a trusted certification authority will eliminate this problem; in the meantime, you can ignore the error. (Another option is to add the self-signed certificate to the user's trusted certificate authority certificate store.)\n\n    ![SSL example web site][3]\n\nIf you want to use SSL for a staging deployment instead of a production deployment, you'll first need to determine the URL used for the staging deployment. Deploy your cloud service to the staging environment without including a certificate or any certificate information. Once deployed, you can determine the GUID-based URL, which is listed in the management portal's **Site URL** field. Create a certificate with the common name (CN) equal to the GUID-based URL (for example, **32818777-6e77-4ced-a8fc-57609d404462.cloudapp.net**), use the management portal to add the certificate to your staged cloud service, add the certificate information to your CSDEF and CSCFG files, repackage your application, and update your staged deployment to use the new package and CSCFG file.\n\n  [Azure Management Portal]: http://manage.windowsazure.com\n  [0]: ./media/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate/CreateCloudService.png\n  [1]: ./media/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate/AddCertificate.png\n  [2]: ./media/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate/CopyURL.png\n  [3]: ./media/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate/SSLCloudService.png\n  [4]: ./media/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate/AddCertificateComplete.png  \n\ntest\n"
