After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.</p>\n\nThis tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:\n\n1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]\n2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]\n3. [Add authentication to the app]\n\nThis tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].\n\nCompleting this tutorial requires Xamarin.Android and Android SDK 4.2 or a later version.\n\n##<a name=\"register\"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)]\n\n##<a name=\"permissions\"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users\n\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-javascript-backend](../../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-javascript-backend.md)]\n\n\n3. In Eclipse, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].\n\n4. From the **Run** menu, then click **Run** to start the app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.\n\n     This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the _TodoItem_ table now requires authentication.\n\nNext, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.\n\n##<a name=\"add-authentication\"></a>Add authentication to the app\n\n1. Add the following property to the **ToDoActivity** class:\n\n        private MobileServiceUser user;\n\n2. Add the following method to the **ToDoActivity** class:\n\n        private async Task Authenticate()\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                user = await client.LoginAsync(this, MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.MicrosoftAccount);\n                CreateAndShowDialog(string.Format(\"you are now logged in - {0}\", user.UserId), \"Logged in!\");\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                CreateAndShowDialog(ex, \"Authentication failed\");\n            }\n        }\n\n    This creates a new method to handle the authentication process. The user is authenticated by using a Microsoft Account login. A dialog is displayed which displays the ID of the authenticated user. You cannot proceed without a positive authentication.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] If you are using an identity provider other than Microsoft, change the value passed to the **login** method above to one of the following: _Facebook_, _Google_, _Twitter_, or _WindowsAzureActiveDirectory_.\n\n3. In the **OnCreate** method, add the following line of code after the code that instantiates the `MobileServiceClient` object.\n\n        await Authenticate();\n\n    This call starts the authentication process and awaits it asynchronously.\n\n4. Move the remaining code after `await Authenticate();` in the **OnCreate** method to a new **CreateTable** method, which looks like this:\n\n        private async Task CreateTable()\n        {\n\n            await InitLocalStoreAsync();\n\n            // Get the Mobile Service Table instance to use\n            toDoTable = client.GetTable<ToDoItem>();\n\n            textNewToDo = FindViewById<EditText>(Resource.Id.textNewToDo);\n\n            // Create an adapter to bind the items with the view\n            adapter = new ToDoItemAdapter(this, Resource.Layout.Row_List_To_Do);\n            var listViewTodo = FindViewById<ListView>(Resource.Id.listViewToDo);\n            listViewTodo.Adapter = adapter;\n\n            // Load the items from the Mobile Service\n            await RefreshItemsFromTableAsync();\n        }\n\n5. Then call the new **CreateTable** method in **OnCreate** after the **Authenticate** call added in step 2:\n\n        await CreateTable();\n\n\n6. From the **Run** menu, then click **Run** to start the app and sign in with your chosen identity provider.\n\n    When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.\n\n## Get completed example\nDownload the [completed example project].
