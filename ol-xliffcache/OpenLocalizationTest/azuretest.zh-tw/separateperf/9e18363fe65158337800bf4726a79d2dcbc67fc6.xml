The application running on the Azure virtual machine.\n2.  The Azure virtual machine.\n3.  Azure endpoints for the cloud service that contains the virtual machine (for virtual machines created using the Service Management API), inbound NAT rules (for virtual machines created in Resource Manager), and Network Security Groups.\n4.  Your Internet edge device.\n\nFor client computers that are accessing the application over a site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute connection, the main areas that can cause problems are the application and the Azure virtual machine.\nTo determine the source of the problem and its correction, follow these steps.\n\n## Step 1: Can you access the application from the target virtual machine?\n\nTry to access the application with the appropriate client program from the virtual machine on which the application is running, Use the local host name, the local IP address, or the loopback address (127.0.0.1).\n\n![](./media/virtual-machines-troubleshoot-access-application/tshoot_app_access2.png)\n\nFor example, if the application is a web server, run a browser on the virtual machine and try to access a web page hosted on the virtual machine.\n\nIf you can access the application, go to [Step 2](#step2).\n\nIf you cannot access the application, verify the following:\n\n- The application is running on the target virtual machine.\n- The application is listening on the expected TCP and UDP ports.\n\nOn both Windows and Linux-based virtual machines, use the **netstat -a** command to show the active listening ports. Examine the output for the expected ports on which your application should be listening. Restart the application or configure it to use the expected ports as needed.\n\n## <a id=\"step2\"></a>Step 2: Can you access the application from another virtual machine in the same virtual network?\n\nTry to access the application from a different virtual machine in the same virtual network as the virtual machine on which the application is running using the virtual machine's host name or its Azure-assigned public, private, or provider IP address. For virtual machines created using the Service Management API, do not use the public IP address of the cloud service.\n\n![](./media/virtual-machines-troubleshoot-access-application/tshoot_app_access3.png)\n\nFor example, if the application is a web server, try to access a web page from a browser on a different virtual machine in the same virtual network.\n\nIf you can access the application, go to [Step 3](#step3).\n\nIf you cannot access the application, verify the following:\n\n- The host firewall on the target virtual machine is allowing the inbound request and outbound response traffic.\n- Intrusion detection or network monitoring software running on the target virtual machine is allowing the traffic.\n- Network Security Groups are allowing the traffic.\n- A separate component running in your virtual network in the path between the test virtual machine and the virtual machine, such as a load balancer or firewall, is allowing the traffic.\n\nOn a Windows-based virtual machine, use Windows Firewall with Advanced Security to determine whether the firewall rules exclude your application's inbound and outbound traffic.\n\n## <a id=\"step3\"></a>Step 3: Can you access the application from a computer that is outside the virtual network, but not connected to the same network as your computer?\n\nTry to access the application from a computer outside the virtual network as the virtual machine on which the application is running, but is not on the same network as your original client computer.\n\n![](./media/virtual-machines-troubleshoot-access-application/tshoot_app_access4.png)\n\nFor example, if the application is a web server, try to access the web page from a browser running on a computer that is not in the virtual network.\n\nIf you cannot access the application, verify the following:\n\n- For virtual machines created using the Service Management API, that the endpoint configuration for the virtual machine is allowing the incoming traffic, especially the protocol (TCP or UDP) and the public and private port numbers.
