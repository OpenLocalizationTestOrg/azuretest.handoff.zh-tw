After you activate V12 for your subscription, the create and upgrade options for V12 become unlocked in the Azure preview portal. Then users can initiate the [create](sql-database-create.md) workflow from the server blade or the database blade.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE]\n> Test databases, database copies, or new databases, are good candidates for upgrading to the preview. Production databases that your business depends on should wait until after the preview period.\n\nFor more information about the upgrade to V12, see [Plan and Prepare to Upgrade to Azure SQL Database V12](sql-database-v12-plan-prepare-upgrade.md).\n\n\n## A. Security authorization\n\nThe first step is to ensure that you have sufficient authorization to activate V12 for your subscription. When you attempt to activate the V12 option, an authorization check is performed to verify you have sufficient authority within the subscription.\n\n To try V12 you must have one of the following authorizations:\n\n- The subscription owner\n- A co-administrator of the subscription\n\nFor more information about Azure accounts, see [Manage Accounts, Subscriptions, and Administrative Roles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh531793.aspx).\n\n## B. Steps in the Azure preview portal UI\n\nThis section describes a click sequence that you can follow one time in the Azure preview portal UI to activate V12 option. After you activate the option, it remains available thereafter.\n\nAll the activation scenarios use the same basic idea. When you first try to [create a new SQL Database server](sql-database-create.md), a blade labeled **Latest Update (preview)** is displayed that offers a check box that you can select to activate your privilege to use V12 version. After you activate the privilege, you never see the check box again. Instead you see a **Yes|No** control you can use to specify whether you want your new server to use V12. If you choose **No**, you create a V11 server (as reported by SELECT @@VERSION;).\n\n### B.1 Yes|No control for the V12 version\n\nAfter you have activated the V12 option privilege, you see the **Yes|No** control that is circled in the following Azure preview portal screenshot.\n\n![YesNoOptionForTheV12Preview][Image1]\n\n\n## C. What's next\n\nNext, the following topics explain ways you can use SQL Database V12.\n\n- [Create a database in SQL Database Update V12](sql-database-create.md)\n\n\n<!-- References, Images. -->\n[Image1]: ./media/sql-database-v12-sign-up/V12Preview-YesNo-Option-New-SQLDatabase-Server-Newserver-Screenshot-e23.png\n\n "
