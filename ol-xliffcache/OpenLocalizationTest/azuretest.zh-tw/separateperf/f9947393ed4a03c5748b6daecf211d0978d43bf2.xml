Runbooks may use cmdlets that accept a PSCredential object for authentication, or the runbook may extract the username and password of the PSCredential object to provide to some application or service requiring authentication. The properties for a credential are stored securely in Azure Automation and can be accessed in the runbook with the [Get-AutomationPSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.pscredential.aspx) activity.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] Secure assets in Azure Automation include credentials, certificates, connections, and encrypted variables. These assets are encrypted and stored in the Azure Automation using a unique key that is generated for each automation account. This key is encrypted by a master certificate and stored in Azure Automation. Before storing a secure asset, the key for the automation account is decrypted using the master certificate and then used to encrypt the asset.\n\n## Windows PowerShell cmdlets\n\nThe cmdlets in the following table are used to create and manage automation credential assets with Windows PowerShell.  They ship as part of the [Azure PowerShell module](../powershell-install-configure.md) which is available for use in Automation runbooks.\n\n|Cmdlets|Description|\n|:---|:---|\n|[Get-AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn913781.aspx)|Retrieves information about a credential asset. You can only retrieve the credential itself from **Get-AutomationCredential** activity.|\n|[New-AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj554330.aspx)|Creates a new Automation credential.|\n|[Remove- AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj554330.aspx)|Removes an Automation credential.|\n|[Set- AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj554330.aspx)|Sets the properties for an existing Automation credential.|\n\n## Runbook activities\n\nThe activities in the following table are used to access credentials in a runbook.\n\n|Activities|Description|\n|:---|:---|\n|Get-AutomationPSCredential|Gets a credential to use in a runbook. Returns a [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.pscredential) object.|\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] You should avoid using variables in the â€“Name parameter of Get-AutomationPSCredential since this can complicate discovering dependencies between runbooks and credential assets at design time.\n\n## Creating a new credential\n\n\n### To create a new variable with the Azure portal\n\n1. From your automation account, click **Assets** at the top of the window.\n1. At the bottom of the window, click **Add Setting**.\n1. Click **Add Credential**.\n2. In the **Credential Type** dropdown, select **PowerShell Credential**.\n1. Complete the wizard and click the checkbox to save the new credential.\n\n\n### To create a new credential with the Azure preview portal\n\n1. From your automation account, click the **Assets** part to open the **Assets** blade.\n1. Click the **Credentials** part to open the **Credentials** blade.\n1. Click **Add a credential** at the top of the blade.\n1. Complete the form and click **Create** to save the new credential.\n\n\n### To create a new PowerShell credential with Windows PowerShell\n\nThe following sample commands show how to create a new automation credential. A PSCredential object is first created with the name and password and then used to create the credential asset. Alternatively, you could use the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to be prompted to type in a name and password.\n\n    $user = \"MyDomain\\MyUser\"\n    $pw = ConvertTo-SecureString \"PassWord!\" -AsPlainText -Force\n    $cred = New-Object â€“TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential â€“ArgumentList $user, $pw\n    New-AzureAutomationCredential -AutomationAccountName \"MyAutomationAccount\" -Name \"MyCredential\" -Value $cred\n\n## Using a PowerShell credential in a runbook\n\nYou retrieve a credential asset in a runbook with the **Get-AutomationPSCredential** activity. This returns a [PSCredential object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.pscredential.aspx) that you can use with an activity or cmdlet that requires a PSCredential parameter. You can also retrieve the properties of the credential object to use individually. The object has a property for the username and the secure password, or you can use the **GetNetworkCredential** method to return a [NetworkCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.networkcredential.aspx) object that will provide an unsecured version of the password.\n\n### Textual runbook sample\n\nThe following sample commands show how to use a PowerShell credential in a runbook. In this example, the credential is retrieved and its username and password assigned to variables.\n\n    $myCredential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name 'MyCredential'\n    $userName = $myCredential.UserName\n    $securePassword = $myCredential.Password\n    $password = $myCredential.GetNetworkCredential().Password\n\n\n### Graphical runbook sample\n\nYou add a **Get-AutomationPSCredential** activity to a graphical runbook by right-clicking on the credential in the Library pane of the graphical editor and selecting **Add to canvas**.\n\n\n![Add credential to canvas](media/automation-credentials/credential-add-canvas.png)\n\nThe following image shows an example of using a credential in a graphical runbook.  In this case, it is being used to provide authentication for a runbook to Azure resources as described in [Configuring authentication to Azure resources](#automation-configuring.md).  The first activity retrieves the credential that has access to the Azure subscription.  The **Add-AzureAccount** activity then uses this credential to provide authentication for any activities that come after it.  A [pipeline link](automation-graphical-authoring-intro.md#links-and-workflow) is here since **Get-AutomationPSCredential** is expecting a single object.  \n\n![Add credential to canvas](media/automation-credentials/get-credential.png)\n\n\n## Related articles\n\n- [Links in graphical authoring](automation-graphical-authoring-intro.md#links-and-workflow)\n\n \ntest\n"
