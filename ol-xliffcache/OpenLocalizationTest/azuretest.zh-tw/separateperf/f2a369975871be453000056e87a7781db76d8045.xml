These conditions are expressed via a boolean expression that is evaluated with appropriate service-context specific values.\n\n\n## Capabilities\nBy using Placement Constraints, you can:\n\n- Confine different type of services on different types of nodes via defining NodeProperties on the nodes.\n\n- Apply certain constraints to primary replicas but not secondary replicas\n\n\n## Key Concepts\nNodeProperty- A user or system defined map from a string to a value, that can vary over each node, i.e NodeName.\n\n\n<!--Every topic should have next steps and links to the next logical set of content to keep the customer engaged-->\n## Next steps\n\nFor more information: [Application Scenarios](../service-fabric-application-scenarios).\n "
