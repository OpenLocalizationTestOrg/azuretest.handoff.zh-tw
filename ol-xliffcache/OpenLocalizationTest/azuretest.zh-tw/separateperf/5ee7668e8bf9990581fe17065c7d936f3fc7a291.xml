If you have user provisioning for a third party SaaS application enabled, the Azure Management Portal controls its attribute values in form of a configuration called “attribute mapping”.\n\nThere is a preconfigured set of attribute mappings between Azure AD user objects and each SaaS app’s user objects. Some apps manage other types of objects, such as Groups or Contacts. <br> \n You can customize the default attribute mappings according to your business needs. This means, you can change or delete existing attribute mappings or create new attribute mappings.\n\nIn the Azure AD portal, you can access this feature by clicking Attributes in the toolbar of a SaaS application.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The **Attributes** link is only available if you have user provisioning enabled for a SaaS application. \n\n\n![Salesforce][1] \n\n\nWhen you click Attributes in the toolbar, the list of current mappings that are configured for a SaaS application.\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example for this:\n\n\n\n![Salesforce][2]  \n\n\nIn the example above, you can see that the **firstName** attribute of a managed object in Salesforce is populated with the **givenName** value of the linked Azure AD object.\n\nIf you either want to customize your attribute mappings or if you want to revert customized settings back to the default configuration, you can do this by clicking the related button in the toolbar on the bottom of an application.\n\n\n![Salesforce][3]  \n\n\nThere are attribute mappings that are required by a SaaS application to function correctly. \n In the attributes table, the related attribute mappings have **Yes** as value for the **Required** attribute. If an attribute mapping is required, you cannot delete it. In this case, **Delete** feature is unavailable.\n\nTo modify an existing attribute mapping, just select the mapping, and then click **Edit**. This brings up a dialog page that enables you to modify the selected attribute mapping.\n\n\n![Edit Attribute Mapping][4]  \n\n\n\n## Understanding Attribute Mapping Types\n\n\nWith attribute mappings, you control how attributes are populated in a third party SaaS application. \nThere are four different mapping types supported:\n\n- **Direct** – the target attribute is populated with the value of an attribute of the linked object in Azure AD.\n\n\n- **Constant** – the target attribute is populated with a specific string you have specified.\n\n\n- **Expression** - the target attribute is populated based on the result of a script-like expression. \nFor more details, see [Writing Expressions for Attribute Mappings in Azure Active Directory](active-directory-saas-writing-expressions-for-attribute-mappings.md).\n\n\n- **None** - the target attribute is left unmodified. However, if the target attribute is ever empty, it will be populated with the Default value that you specify.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these four basic attribute mapping types, custom attribute mappings support the concept of a **default** value assignment. The default value assignment ensures that a target attribute is populated with a value if there is neither a value in Azure AD nor on the target object.\n\nMicrosoft Azure AD provides a very efficient implementation of a synchronization process. \n In an initialized environment, only objects requiring updates are processed during a synchronization cycle. \n Updating attribute mappings has an impact on the performance of a synchronization cycle. \n This is because an update to the attribute mapping configuration requires all managed objects to be reevaluated. \n Because of this, it is a recommended best practice to keep the number of consecutive changes to your attribute mappings at a minimum.\n\n\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [saas-toc](../../includes/active-directory-saas-toc.md)]\n\n<!--Image references-->\n[1]: ./media/active-directory-saas-customizing-attribute-mappings/ic765497.png\n[2]: ./media/active-directory-saas-customizing-attribute-mappings/ic775419.png\n[3]: ./media/active-directory-saas-customizing-attribute-mappings/ic775420.png\n[4]: ./media/active-directory-saas-customizing-attribute-mappings/ic775421.png\n\ntest\n"
