After you collect data into Event Hubs, you can store the data using a storage cluster or transform it using a real-time analytics provider. This large scale event collection and processing capability is a key component of modern application architectures including the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nThis tutorial shows how to use the Azure portal to create an Event Hub. It also shows you how to collect messages into an Event Hub using a console application written in C#, and how to retrieve them in parallel using the C# [Event Processor Host] library.\n\nIn order to complete this tutorial you'll need the following:\n\n+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, or Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows.\n\n+ An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started%2F target=\"_blank\").\n\n## Create an Event Hub\n\n1. Log on to the [Azure management portal], and click **NEW** at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. Click **App Services**, then **Service Bus**, then **Event Hub**, then **Quick Create**.\n\n    ![][1]\n\n3. Type a name for your Event Hub, select your desired region, and then click **Create a new Event Hub**.\n\n    ![][2]\n\n4. Click the namespace you just created (usually ***event hub name*-ns**).\n\n    ![][3]\n\n5. Click the **Event Hubs** tab at the top of the page, and then click the Event Hub you just created.\n\n    ![][4]\n\n6. Click the **Configure** tab at the top, add a rule named **SendRule** with *Send* rights, add another rule called **ReceiveRule** with *Manage, Send, Listen* rights, and then click **Save**.\n\n    ![][5]\n\n7. Click the **Dashboard** tab at the top of the page, and then click **Connection Information**. Take note of the two connection strings, or copy them somewhere to use later in this tutorial.\n\n    ![][6]\n\nYour Event Hub is now created, and you have the connection strings you need to send and receive events.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-send-csharp](../../includes/service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-send-csharp.md)]\n\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-receive-ephcs](../../includes/service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-receive-ephcs.md)]\n\n## Run the applications\n\nNow you are ready to run the applications.\n\n1.  From within Visual Studio, run the **Receiver** project, then wait for it to start the receivers for all the partitions.\n\n    ![][21]\n\n2.  Run the **Sender** project, press **Enter** in the console windows, and see the events appear in the receiver window.\n\n    ![][22]\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you've built a working application that creates an Event Hub and sends and receives data, you can move on to the following scenarios:\n\n- A complete [sample application that uses Event Hubs].\n- The [Scale out Event Processing with Event Hubs] sample.\n- A [queued messaging solution] using Service Bus queues.\n- [Event Hubs overview]\n\n<!-- Images. -->\n[1]: ./media/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/create-event-hub1.png\n[2]: ./media/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/create-event-hub2.png\n[3]: ./media/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/create-event-hub3.png\n[4]: ./media/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/create-event-hub4.png\n[5]: ./media/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/create-event-hub5.png\n[6]: ./media/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/create-event-hub6.png\n\n[21]: ./media/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/run-csharp-ephcs1.png\n[22]: ./media/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/run-csharp-ephcs2.png\n\n<!-- Links -->\n[Azure Management Portal]: https://manage.windowsazure.com/\n[Event Processor Host]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.EventProcessorHost\n[Event Hubs overview]: event-hubs-overview.md\n[sample application that uses Event Hubs]: https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazure/Service-Bus-Event-Hub-286fd097\n[Scale out Event Processing with Event Hubs]: https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazure/Service-Bus-Event-Hub-45f43fc3\n[queued messaging solution]: ../service-bus-dotnet-multi-tier-app-using-service-bus-queues.md\n \n\ntest\n"
