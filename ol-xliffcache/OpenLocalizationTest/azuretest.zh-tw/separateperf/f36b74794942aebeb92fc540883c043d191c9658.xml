These deployment tutorials apply to StorSimple 8000 Series Update 1.0. This series of tutorials describes how to configure your StorSimple device, and includes a configuration checklist, configuration prerequisites, and detailed configuration steps.\n\nThe information in these tutorials assumes that you have reviewed the safety precautions, and unpacked, racked, and cabled your StorSimple device. If you still need to perform those tasks, start with reviewing the [safety precautions](storsimple-safety.md). Depending on your device model, you can then unpack, rack mount, and cable by following the instructions in:\n\n- [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8100](storsimple-8100-hardware-installation.md)\n- [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8600](storsimple-8600-hardware-installation.md)\n\nYou will need administrator privileges to complete the setup and configuration process. We recommend that you review the configuration checklist before you begin. The deployment and configuration process can take some time to complete.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The StorSimple deployment information published on the Microsoft Azure website applies to StorSimple 8000 series devices only. For complete information about the 7000 series devices, go to: [http://onlinehelp.storsimple.com/](http://onlinehelp.storsimple.com). For 7000 series deployment information, see the [StorSimple System Quick Start Guide](http://onlinehelp.storsimple.com/111_Appliance/).\n\n## Deployment steps\n\nPerform these required steps to configure your StorSimple device and connect it to your StorSimple Manager service. In addition to the required steps, there are optional steps and procedures you may need during the deployment. The step-by-step deployment instructions indicate when you should perform each of these optional steps.\n\n\n| Step                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **PREREQUISITES**                                                                      | These need to be completed in preparation for the upcoming deployment.                                                                                        |\n| Deployment configuration checklist.                                                     | Use this checklist to gather and record information prior to and during the deployment.                                                                       |\n| Deployment prerequisites.                                                               | These  validate the environment is ready for deployment.                                                                                                     |\n|                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT**                                                                   | These steps are required to deploy your StorSimple device in production.                                                                                      |\n| Step 1: Create a new service.                                                         | Set up cloud management and storage for your   StorSimple device.

StorSimple device.\n\n### For the StorSimple Manager service\n\nBefore you begin, make sure that:\n\n- You have your Microsoft account with access credentials.\n\n- You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.\n\n- Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for the StorSimple Manager service. Your subscription should be purchased through the [Enterprise Agreement](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/).\n\n- You have access to terminal emulation software such as PuTTY.\n\n### For the device in the datacenter\n\nBefore configuring the device, make sure that:\n\n- Your device is fully unpacked, mounted on a rack and fully cabled for power, network, and serial access as described in:\n\n    -  [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8100 device](storsimple-8100-hardware-installation.md)\n    -  [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8600 device](storsimple-8600-hardware-installation.md)\n\n\n### For the network in the datacenter\n\nBefore you begin, make sure that:\n\n- The ports in your datacenter firewall are opened to allow for iSCSI and cloud traffic as described in [Networking requirements for your StorSimple device](storsimple-system-requirements.md#networking-requirements-for-your-storsimple-device).\n\n\n## Step-by-step deployment\n\nUse the following step-by-step instructions to deploy your StorSimple device in the datacenter.\n\n## Step 1: Create a new service\n\nA StorSimple Manager service can manage multiple StorSimple devices. Perform the following steps to create a new instance of the StorSimple Manager service.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-create-new-service](../../includes/storsimple-create-new-service.md)]\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you did not enable the automatic creation of a storage account with your service, you will need to create at least one storage account after you have successfully created a service. This storage account will be used when you create a volume container. \n>\n> * If you did not create a storage account automatically, go to [Configure a new storage account for the service](#configure-a-new-storage-account-for-the-service) for detailed instructions. \n> * If you enabled the automatic creation of a storage account, go to [Step 2: Get the service registration key](#step-2-get-the-service-registration-key).\n\n## Step 2: Get the service registration key\n\nAfter the StorSimple Manager service is up and running, you will need to get the service registration key. This key is used to register and connect your StorSimple device with the service.\n\nPerform the following steps in the Management Portal.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-get-service-registration-key](../../includes/storsimple-get-service-registration-key.md)]\n\n\n## Step 3: Configure and register the device through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple\n\nUse Windows PowerShell for StorSimple to complete the initial setup of your StorSimple device as explained in the following procedure. You will need to use terminal emulation software to complete this step. For more information, see [Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console](#use-putty-to-connect-to-the-device-serial-console).\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1](../../includes/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1.md)]\n\n## Step 4: Complete minimum device setup\n\nFor the minimum device configuration of your StorSimple device, you are required to: \n\n- Set up the secondary DNS server.\n- Enable iSCSI on at least one network interface.\n- Assign fixed IP addresses to both the controllers.\n\nPerform the following steps in the Management Portal to complete the minimum device setup.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup](../../includes/storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup-u1.md)]\n\n## Step 5: Create a volume container\n\nA volume container has storage account, bandwidth, and encryption settings for all the volumes contained in it. You will need to create a volume container before you can start provisioning volumes on your StorSimple device. \n\nPerform the following steps in the Management Portal to create a volume container.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-create-volume-container](../../includes/storsimple-create-volume-container.md)]\n\n## Step 6: Create a volume\n\nAfter you create a volume container, you can provision a storage volume on the StorSimple device for your servers. Perform the following steps in the Management Portal to create a volume.\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] StorSimple Manager can create only thinly provisioned volumes. You cannot create fully provisioned or partially provisioned volumes. \n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-create-volume](../../includes/storsimple-create-volume.md)]\n\n## Step 7: Mount, initialize, and format a volume\n\nThe following steps are performed on your Windows Server host. \n\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT]\n\n> - For the high availability of your StorSimple solution, we recommend that you configure MPIO on your host servers (optional) prior to configuring iSCSI. MPIO configuration on host servers will ensure that the servers can tolerate a link, network, or interface failure.\n\n> - For MPIO and iSCSI installation and configuration instructions on Windows Server host, go to [Configure MPIO for your StorSimple device](storsimple-configure-mpio-windows-server.md). These will also include the steps to mount, initialize and format StorSimple volumes.\n\n> - For MPIO and iSCSI installation and configuration instructions on a Linux host, go to [Configure MPIO for your StorSimple Linux host](storsimple-configure-mpio-linux.md)\n\nIf you decide not to configure MPIO, perform the following steps to mount, initialize, and format your StorSimple volumes on a Windows Server host.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-mount-initialize-format-volume](../../includes/storsimple-mount-initialize-format-volume.md)]\n\n## Step 8: Take a backup\n\nBackups provide point-in-time protection of volumes and improve recoverability while minimizing restore times. You can take two types of backup on your StorSimple device: local snapshots and cloud snapshots. Each of these backup types can be **Scheduled** or **Manual**. \n\nPerform the following steps in the Management Portal to create a scheduled backup.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-take-backup](../../includes/storsimple-take-backup.md)]\n\nYou can take a manual backup at any time. For procedures, go to [Create a manual backup](#create-a-manual-backup). \n\n## Configure a new storage account for the service\n\nThis is an optional step that you need to perform only if you did not enable the automatic creation of a storage account with your service. A Microsoft Azure storage account is required to create a StorSimple volume container.\n\nIf you need to create an Azure storage account in a different region, see [About Azure Storage Accounts](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md) for step-by-step instructions.\n\nPerform the following steps in the Management Portal, on the **StorSimple Manager service** page.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-configure-new-storage-account-u1](../../includes/storsimple-configure-new-storage-account-u1.md)]\n\n\n## Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console\n\nTo connect to Windows PowerShell for StorSimple, you need to use terminal emulation software such as PuTTY. You can use PuTTY when you access the device directly through the serial console or by opening a telnet session from a remote computer.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console](../../includes/storsimple-use-putty.md)]\n\n\n## Scan for and apply updates\n\nUpdating your device can take several hours. Perform the following steps to scan for and apply updates on your device.\n<!-- > can take 1-4 hours--> \n\n<!-- > [AZURE.NOTE] If you have a gateway configured on a network interface other than Data 0, you will need to disable Data 2 and Data 3 network interfaces before installing the update. Go to **Devices > Configure** and disable Data 2 and Data 3 interfaces. You should re-enable these interfaces after the device is updated.-->\n\n#### To update your device\n\n1.  On the device **Quick Start** page, click **Devices**. Select the physical device, click **Maintenance** and then click **Scan Updates**.  \n\n2.  A job to scan for available updates is created. If updates are available, the **Scan Updates** changes to **Install Updates**. Click **Install Updates**. \n\n3.  An update job will be created. Monitor the status of your update by navigating to **Jobs**.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] When the update job starts, it immediately displays the status as 50 percent. The status changes to 100 percent only after the update job is complete. There is no real-time status for the update process.\n\n4.  After the device is successfully updated, enable Data 2 and Data 3 network interfaces if these were disabled.\n\n<!-- In step 2, you may be requested to disable Data 2 and Data 3 prior to installing the updates. You must disable these network interfaces or the updates may fail.-->\n\n## Get the IQN of a Windows Server host\n\nPerform the following steps to get the iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) of a Windows host that is running Windows Server® 2012.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [Create a manual backup](../../includes/storsimple-get-iqn.md)]\n\n## Create a manual backup\n\nPerform the following steps in the Management Portal to create an on-demand manual backup for a single volume on your StorSimple device.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [Create a manual backup](../../includes/storsimple-create-manual-backup.md)]\n\n## Configure MPIO\n\nMultipath I/O (MPIO) is an optional feature and is not installed on Windows Server by default. It should be installed as a feature through Server Manager. For MPIO installation instructions, go to [Configure MPIO for your StorSimple device](storsimple-configure-mpio-windows-server.md).\n\nFor MPIO installation instructions for a StorSimple device connected to a Linux host, go to [Configure MPIO for your Linux host](storsimple-configure-mpio-linux.md).\n\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] MPIO is not supported on a StorSimple virtual device. \n\n\n\n## Next steps\n\nConfigure a [virtual device](storsimple-virtual-device.md).\n\nUse the [StorSimple Manager service](storsimple-manager-service-administration.md) to manage your StorSimple device.\n \n"
