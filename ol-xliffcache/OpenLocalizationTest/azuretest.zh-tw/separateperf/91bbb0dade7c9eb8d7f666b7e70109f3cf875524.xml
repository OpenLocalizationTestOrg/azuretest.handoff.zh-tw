Each branch should be limited to a single concept/article both to streamline work flow and reduce the possibility of merge conflicts.  The following efforts are of the appropriate scope for a new branch:\n\n* A new article (and associated images)\n* Spelling and grammar edits on an article.\n* Applying a single formatting change across a large set of articles (e.g. new copyright footer).\n\n## How to use markdown to format your topic\n\nAll the articles in this repository use GitHub flavored markdown.  Here's a list of resources.\n\n- [Markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)\n\n- [Printable markdown cheatsheet](./contributor-guide/media/documents/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf?raw=true)\n\n- For our list of markdown editors, see the [tools and setup topic](./contributor-guide/tools-and-setup.md#install-a-markdown-editor).\n\n## Article metadata\n\nArticle metadata enables certain functionalities on the azure.microsoft.com web site, such as author attribution, contributor attribution, breadcrumbs, article descriptions, and SEO optimizations as well as reporting Microsoft uses to evaluate the performance of the content. So, the metadata is important! [Here's the guidance for making sure your metadata is done right](./contributor-guide/article-metadata.md).\n\n## More resources\n\nSee the [index of our contributor's guide](./contributor-guide/contributor-guide-index.md) for all our guidance topics.\n\ntest\n"
