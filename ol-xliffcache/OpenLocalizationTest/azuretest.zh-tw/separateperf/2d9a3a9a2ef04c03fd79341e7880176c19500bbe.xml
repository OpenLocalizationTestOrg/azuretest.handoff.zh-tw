It then schedules and runs those actions automatically.  Scheduler does this by using [the Azure portal](scheduler-get-started-portal.md), code, [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn528946), or Azure PowerShell.\n\nScheduler creates, maintains, and invokes scheduled work.  Scheduler does not host any workloads or run any code. It only _invokes_ code hosted elsewhere—in Azure, on-premises, or with another provider. It invokes via HTTP, HTTPS, or a storage queue.\n\nScheduler schedules [jobs](scheduler-concepts-terms.md), keeps a history of job execution results that one can review, and deterministically and reliably schedules workloads to be run. Azure WebJobs (part of the Web Apps feature in Azure App Service) and other Azure scheduling capabilities use Scheduler in the background. The [Scheduler REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn528946) helps manage the communication for these actions. As such, Scheduler supports [complex schedules and advanced recurrence](scheduler-advanced-complexity.md) easily.\n\nThere are several scenarios that lend themselves to the usage of Scheduler. For example:\n\n+ _Recurring application actions:_ Periodically gathering data from Twitter into a feed.\n+ _Daily maintenance:_ Daily pruning of logs, performing backups, and other maintenance tasks. For example, an administrator may choose to back up the database at 1:00 A.M. every day for the next nine months.\n\nScheduler allows you to create, update, delete, view, and manage jobs and [job collections](scheduler-concepts-terms.md) programmatically, by using scripts, and in the portal.\n\n## See also\n\n [Azure Scheduler concepts, terminology, and entity hierarchy](scheduler-concepts-terms.md)\n\n [Get started using Azure Scheduler in the Azure portal](scheduler-get-started-portal.md)\n\n [Plans and billing in Azure Scheduler](scheduler-plans-billing.md)\n\n [How to build complex schedules and advanced recurrence with Azure Scheduler](scheduler-advanced-complexity.md)\n\n [Azure Scheduler REST API reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn528946)\n\n [Azure Scheduler PowerShell cmdlets reference](scheduler-powershell-reference.md)\n\n [Azure Scheduler high-availability and reliability](scheduler-high-availability-reliability.md)\n\n [Azure Scheduler limits, defaults, and error codes](scheduler-limits-defaults-errors.md)\n\n [Azure Scheduler outbound authentication](scheduler-outbound-authentication.md)\n"
