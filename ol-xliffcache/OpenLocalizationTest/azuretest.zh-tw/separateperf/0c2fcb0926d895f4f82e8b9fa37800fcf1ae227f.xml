This image includes the operating system disk and any data disks that are attached to the virtual machine. It doesn't include networking configurations, so you'll need to configure those when you create the other virtual machines that use the template.\n\nAzure stores the image under **My Images**. This is the same place where any images you've uploaded are stored. For details about images, see [About virtual machine images in Azure] [].\n\n##Before you begin##\n\nThese steps assume that you've already created an Azure virtual machine and configured the operating system, including attaching any data disks. If you haven't done this yet, see these instructions:\n\n- [Create a custom virtual machine running Windows] []\n- [How to attach a data disk to a virtual machine] []\n\n> [AZURE.WARNING] This process deletes the original virtual machine after it's captured, and is not intended as a way to back up a virtual machine.

Other solutions are available from certified partners. To find out what’s currently available, search the Azure Marketplace.\n\n##Capture the virtual machine##\n\n1. In the [Azure portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com), **Connect** to the virtual machine. For instructions, see [How to sign in to a virtual machine running Windows Server] [].\n\n2.  Open a Command Prompt window as an administrator.\n\n3.  Change the directory to `%windir%\\system32\\sysprep`, and then run sysprep.exe.\n\n4.  The **System Preparation Tool** dialog box appears. Do the following:\n\n    - In **System Cleanup Action**, select **Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)** and make sure that **Generalize** is checked. For more information about using Sysprep, see [How to Use Sysprep: An Introduction][].\n\n    - In **Shutdown Options**, select **Shutdown**.\n\n    - Click **OK**.\n\n    ![Run Sysprep](./media/virtual-machines-capture-image-windows-server/SysprepGeneral.png)\n\n7.  Sysprep shuts down the virtual machine, which changes the status of the virtual machine in the Azure portal to **Stopped**.\n\n8.

On the command bar, click **Capture**.\n\n    ![Capture virtual machine](./media/virtual-machines-capture-image-windows-server/CaptureVM.png)\n\n    The **Capture the Virtual Machine** dialog box appears.\n\n10. In **Image Name**, type a name for the new image.\n\n11. Before you add a Windows Server image to your set of custom images, it must be generalized by running Sysprep as instructed in the previous steps. Click **I have run Sysprep on the virtual machine** to indicate you did that.\n\n12. Click the check mark to capture the image.
