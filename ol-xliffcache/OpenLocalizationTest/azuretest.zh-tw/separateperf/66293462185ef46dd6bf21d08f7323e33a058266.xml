When you have completed this tutorial, you will be able to broadcast push notifications to all the devices or target-specific users based on their devices properties.\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates the simple broadcast scenario using Mobile Engagement. Be sure to follow along with the next tutorial to see how to use Mobile Engagement to address specific users and groups of devices.\n\nThis tutorial requires the following:\n\n+ XCode, which you can install from your MAC App Store\n+ the [Mobile Engagement iOS SDK]\n+ Push notification certificate (.p12) that you can obtain on your Apple Dev Center\n\nCompleting this tutorial is a prerequisite for all other Mobile Engagement tutorials for iOS apps.\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Completing this tutorial is a prerequisite for all other Mobile Engagement tutorials for iOS apps, and to complete it, you must have an active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href=\"http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Free Trial</a>.\n\n<!--\n##<a id=\"register\"></a>Enable Apple Push Notification Service\n\n[WACOM.INCLUDE [Enable Apple Push Notifications](../../includes/enable-apple-push-notifications.md)]\n-->\n\n##<a id=\"setup-azme\"></a>Set up Mobile Engagement for your app\n\n1. Sign in to the Azure portal, and then click **+NEW** at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. Click **App Services**, click **Mobile Engagement**, and then click  **Create**.\n\n    ![][7]\n\n3. In the pop-up that appears, enter the following information:\n\n   ![][8]\n\n   - **Application Name**: Type the name of your application. Feel free to use any character.\n   - **Platform**: Select the target platform (**iOS**) for the app (if your app targets multiple platforms, repeat this tutorial for each platform).\n   - **Application Resource Name**: This is the name by which this application will be accessible via APIs and URLs. You must only use conventional URL characters. The auto-generated name should provide you a strong basis. You should also append the platform name to avoid any name clash because this name must be unique.\n   - **Location**: Select the datacenter where this app (and more importantly its Collection) will be hosted.\n   - **Collection**: If you have already created an application, select a previously created **Collection**; otherwise select **New Collection**.\n   - **Collection Name**: This represents your group of applications. It also ensures that all your apps are in a group that allows aggregated calculations of metrics. You should use your company name or department here if applicable.\n\n4. Select the app you just created in the **Applications** tab.\n\n5. Click **Connection Info** in order to display the connection settings to put into your SDK integration in your mobile app.\n\n    ![][10]\n\n6. Copy the **Connection String** - This is what you will need to identify this app in your Application code and connect with Mobile Engagement from your phone app.\n\n    ![][11]\n\n##<a id=\"connecting-app\"></a>Connect your app to the Mobile Engagement backend\n\nThis tutorial presents a \"basic integration\", which is the minimal set required to collect data and send a push notification. The complete integration documentation can be found in the Mobile Engagement iOS SDK documentation.\n\nWe will create a basic app with XCode to demonstrate the integration.\n\n###Create a new iOS project\n\nYou can skip this step if you already have an app and are familiar with iOS development.\n\n1. Start Xcode and in the pop-up, select **Create a new Xcode project**.\n\n    ![][12]\n\n2. Select **Single View Application**, and then click **Next**.\n\n    ![][14]\n\n3. Fill in the **Product Name**, **Organization Name**, and **Organization Identifier**. Make sure that you have selected **Objective-C** in the **Language** box.\n\n    ![][13]\n\nXcode will create the demo app into which we integrate Mobile Engagement.\n\n###Connect your app to the Mobile Engagement backend\n\n1. Download the [Mobile Engagement iOS SDK].\n2. Extract the .tar.gz file to a folder in your computer.\n3. Right-click the project, and then select **Add files to**.\n\n    ![][17]\n\n4. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the SDK, select the `EngagementSDK` folder, and then press **OK**.\n\n    ![][18]\n\n5. Open the **Build Phases** tab, and in the **Link Binary With Libraries** menu, add the frameworks as shown below:\n\n    ![][19]\n\n6. Go back to the Azure portal in your app's **Connection Info** page and copy the connection string.\n\n    ![][11]\n\n7. Open your your Application Delegate implementation file and add the following line of code.\n\n        #import \"EngagementAgent.h\"\n\n8. Now paste the connection string in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` delegate.\n\n        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\n        {\n            [...]\n            [EngagementAgent init:@\"Endpoint={YOUR_APP_COLLECTION.DOMAIN};SdkKey={YOUR_SDK_KEY};AppId={YOUR_APPID}\"];\n            [...]\n        }\n\n##<a id=\"monitor\"></a>Enable real-time monitoring\n\nIn order to start sending data and ensuring that the users are active, you must send at least one screen (Activity) to the Mobile Engagement backend.\n\n- Open the **ViewController.h** file, import **EngagementViewController.h**, and replace the super class of the **ViewController** interface by **EngagementViewController**, as shown below:\n\n![][22]\n\n###Ensure your app is connected with real-time monitoring\n\nThis section shows you how to make sure your app connects to the Mobile Engagement backend by using the Mobile Engagement real-time monitoring feature.\n\n1. Navigate to your Mobile Engagement portal\n\n    From your Azure portal, ensure that you're in the app we're using for this project, and then click the **Engage** button at the bottom:\n\n    ![][26]\n\n2. You will land in the **Settings** page in your Engagement portal for your app. From there, click the **Monitor** tab:\n\n    ![][30]\n\n3. The monitor is ready to show you any device, in real time, that will start your app:\n\n    ![][31]\n\n4. Back in Xcode, start your app either in the simulator or in a connected device.\n\n5. If it worked, you should now see one session in the monitor!\n\n**Congratulations!** You succeeded in the first step of this tutorial and have an app that connects to the Mobile Engagement backend and is already sending data.\n\n6. Click the **Home** button of the simulator to bring back the number of sessions in the monitor to 0 as shown above.\n\n    ![][33]\n\n##<a id=\"integrate-push\"></a>Enable push notifications and in-app messaging\n\nMobile Engagement allows you to interact with your users and REACH with push notifications and in-app messaging in the context of campaigns. This module is called REACH in the Mobile Engagement portal.\nThe following sections set up your app to receive them.\n\n### Enable your app to receive Silent Push Notifications\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-engagement-ios-silent-push](../../includes/mobile-engagement-ios-silent-push.md)]  \n\n\n### Add the Reach library to your project\n\n1. Right-click your project.\n2. Select **Add file to**.\n3. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the SDK.\n4. Select the `EngagementReach` folder.\n5. Click **Add**.\n\n### Modify your Application Delegate\n\n1. At the top of your implementation file, import the Engagement Reach module.\n\n        #import \"AEReachModule.h\"\n\n2. Inside the **application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** method, create a Reach module and pass it to your existing Engagement initialization line:\n\n        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n            AEReachModule * reach = [AEReachModule moduleWithNotificationIcon:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"icon.png\"]];\n            [EngagementAgent init:@\"Endpoint={YOUR_APP_COLLECTION.DOMAIN};SdkKey={YOUR_SDK_KEY};AppId={YOUR_APPID}\" modules:reach, nil];\n            [...]\n            return YES;\n        }\n\n###Enable your app to receive APNS Push Notifications\n\n1. Add the following line to the **application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** method:\n\n        if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {\n            [application registerUserNotificationSettings:[UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:(UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound | UIUserNotificationTypeAlert) categories:nil]];\n            [application registerForRemoteNotifications];\n        }\n        else {\n\n            [application registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:(UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];\n        }\n\n2. Add the **application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken** method as follows:\n\n        - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken\n        {\n            [[EngagementAgent shared] registerDeviceToken:deviceToken];\n        }\n\n3. Add the **didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler** method as follows:\n\n        - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))handler\n        {\n            [[EngagementAgent shared] applicationDidReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:handler];\n        }\n\n###Grant Mobile Engagement access to your push certificate\n\nTo allow Mobile Engagement to send push notifications on your behalf, you need to grant it access to your certificate. This is done by configuring and entering your certificate into the Mobile Engagement portal. Make sure you obtain your .p12 certificate as explained in the Apple documentation.\n\n1. Navigate to your Mobile Engagement portal. Ensure you're in the app we're using for this project, and then click the **Engage** button at the bottom:\n\n    ![][26]\n\n2. You will land in the **Settings** page in your Engagement portal. From there, click the **Native Push** section to upload your p12 certificate:\n\n    ![][27]\n\n3. Select your p12, upload it, and then type your password:\n\n    ![][28]\n\n4. Now add your provisioning profile and build your app for a target device.\n\nYou're all set. Now we will verify that you have correctly carried out this basic integration.\n\n##<a id=\"send\"></a>Send a notification to your app\n\nWe will now create a simple push notification campaign that will send a push to our app:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Reach** tab in your Mobile Engagement portal.\n\n2. Click **New Announcement** to create your push notification campaign.\n\n    ![][35]\n\n3. Set up the first field of your campaign:\n\n    ![][36]\n\n    -   Name your campaign with any name you like.\n    -   Select the **Delivery time** as **Out of app only**: this is the simple Apple push notification type that features some text.\n    -   In the Notification text, type first the title which will be the first line in the push.\n    -   Then type your message which will be the second line.\n\n\n4. Scroll down, and in the **Content** section, select \"Notification only\".\n\n    ![][37]\n\n5. You're done setting the most basic campaign possible. Now scroll down again, and then create your campaign to save it!\n![][38]\n\n6. Last step: Activate your campaign.\n![][39]\n\n7. You should see a push notification in your device!\n\n<!-- URLs. -->\n[Mobile Engagement iOS SDK]: http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9864553\n[Mobile Engagement Android SDK documentation]: http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9874682\n\n<!-- Images. -->\n[7]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/create-mobile-engagement-app.png\n[8]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/create-azme-popup.png\n[10]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/app-main-page-select-connection-info.png\n[11]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/app-connection-info-page.png\n[12]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/xcode-new-project.png\n[13]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/xcode-project-props.png\n[14]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/xcode-simple-view.png\n[17]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/xcode-add-files.png\n[18]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/xcode-select-engagement-sdk.png\n[19]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/xcode-build-phases.png\n[22]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/xcode-view-controller.png\n[26]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/engage-button.png\n[27]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/engagement-portal.png\n[28]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/native-push-settings.png\n[30]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/clic-monitor-tab.png\n[31]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/monitor.png\n[33]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/monitor-0.png\n[35]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/new-announcement.png\n[36]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/campaign-first-params.png\n[37]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/campaign-content.png\n[38]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/campaign-create.png\n[39]: ./media/mobile-engagement-ios-get-started/campaign-activate.png\n\ntest\n"
