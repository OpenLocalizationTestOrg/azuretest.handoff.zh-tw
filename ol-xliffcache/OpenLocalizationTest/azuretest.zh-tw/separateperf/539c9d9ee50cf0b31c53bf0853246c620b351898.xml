This functionality includes file, network, and registry access, and diagnostics logs and events. \n\n<a id=\"tiers\"></a>\n## App Service plan tiers\n\nWeb Apps runs customer apps in a multi-tenant hosting environment. Web apps deployed in the **Free** and **Shared** tiers run in worker processes on shared virtual machines, while web apps deployed in the **Standard** and **Premium** tiers run on virtual machine(s) dedicated specifically for the web apps associated with a single customer.\n\nBecause Web Apps supports a seamless scaling experience between different tiers, the security configuration enforced for web apps remains the same. This ensures that web applications don't suddenly behave differently, failing in unexpected ways, when a web app switches from one tier to another.\n\n<a id=\"developmentframeworks\"></a>\n## Development Frameworks\n\nWeb Apps tiers control the amount of compute resources (CPU, disk storage, memory, and network egress) available to web apps. However, the breadth of framework functionality available to applications remains the same regardless of the scaling tiers.\n\nWeb Apps supports a variety of development frameworks, including ASP.NET, classic ASP, node.js, PHP and python - all of which run as extensions within IIS. In order to simplify and normalize security configuration, Web apps typically run the various development frameworks with their default settings. One approach to configuring web apps could have been to customize the API surface area and functionality for each individual development framework. Web Apps instead takes a more generic approach by enabling a common baseline of operating system functionality regardless of a web app's development framework.\n\nThe following sections summarize the general kinds of operating system functionality available to web apps on Azure.\n\n<a id=\"FileAccess\"></a>\n##File Access\n\nVarious drives exist within Web Apps, including local drives and network drives.\n\n<a id=\"LocalDrives\"></a>\n### Local drives\n\nAt its core, Web Apps is a service running on top of the Azure PaaS (platform as a service) infrastructure. As a result, the local drives that are \"attached\" to a virtual machine are the same drive types available to any worker role running in Azure. This includes an operating system drive (the D:\\ drive), an application drive that contains Azure Package cspkg files used exclusively by Web Apps (and inaccessible to customers), and a \"user\" drive (the C:\\ drive), whose size varies depending on the size of the VM.\n\n<a id=\"NetworkDrives\"></a>\n### Network drives (aka UNC shares)\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Web Apps that makes web application deployment and maintenance straightforward is that all user content is stored on a set of UNC shares. This model maps very nicely to the common pattern of content storage used by on-premises web hosting environments that have multiple load-balanced servers. \n\nWithin Web Apps there are number of UNC shares created in each data center. A percentage of the user content for all customers in each data center is allocated to each UNC share. Furthermore, all of the file content for a single customer's subscription is always placed on the same UNC share. \n\nNote that due to how cloud services work, the specific virtual machine responsible for hosting a UNC share will change over time. It is guaranteed that UNC shares will be mounted by different virtual machines as they are brought up and down during the normal course of cloud operations. For this reason, web applications should never make hard-coded assumptions that the machine information in a UNC file path will remain stable over time. Instead, they should use the convenient *faux* absolute path **D:\\home\\site** that Web Apps provides. This faux absolute path provides a portable, app-and-user-agnostic method for referring to one's own app. By using **D:\\home\\site**, one can transfer shared files from app to app without having to configure a new absolute path for each transfer.\n\n<a id=\"TypesOfFileAccess\"></a>\n### Types of file access granted to a web application\n\nEach customer's subscription has a reserved directory structure on a specific UNC share within a data center. A customer may have multiple web apps created within a specific data center, so all of the directories belonging to a single customer subscription are created on the same UNC share. The share may include directories such as those for content, error and diagnostic logs, and earlier versions of the web app created by source control. As expected, a customer's web app directories are available for read and write access at runtime by a web app's application code.\n\nOn the local drives attached to the virtual machine that runs a web app, Web Apps reserves a chunk of space on the C:\\ drive for app-specific temporary local storage. Although a web app has full read/write access to its own temporary local storage, that storage really isn't intended to be used directly by application code. Rather, the intent is to provide temporary file storage for IIS and web application frameworks. Web Apps also limits the amount of temporary local storage available to each web app to prevent individual apps from consuming excessive amounts of local file storage.\n\nTwo examples of how Web Apps uses temporary local storage are the directory for temporary ASP.NET files and the directory for IIS compressed files. The ASP.NET compilation system uses the \"Temporary ASP.NET Files\" directory as a temporary compilation cache location. IIS uses the \"IIS Temporary Compressed Files\" directory to store compressed response output. Both of these types of file usage (as well as others) are remapped in Web Apps to per-app temporary local storage. This remapping ensures that functionality continues as expected.\n\nEach app in Web Apps runs as a random unique low-privileged worker process identity called the \"application pool identity\", described further here: [http://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security/application-pool-identities](http://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security/application-pool-identities). Application code uses this identity for basic read-only access to the operating system drive (the D:\\ drive). This means application code can list common directory structures and read common files on operating system drive. Although this might appear to be a somewhat broad level of access, the same directories and files are accessible when you provision a worker role in an Azure hosted service and read the drive contents. \n\n<a name=\"multipleinstances\"></a>\n### File access across multiple instances\n\nThe home directory contains an app's content, and web applications can write to it. If a web app runs on multiple instances, the home directory is shared among all instances so that all instances see the same directory. So, for example, if a web app saves uploaded files to the home directory, those files are immediately available to all instances. \n\n<a id=\"NetworkAccess\"></a>\n## Network Access\nApplication code can use TCP/IP and UDP based protocols to make outbound network connections to Internet accessible endpoints that expose external services. Applications can use these same protocols to connect to services within Azure&#151;for example, by establishing HTTPS connections to SQL Azure.\n\nThere is also a limited capability for applications to establish one local loopback connection, and have an application listen on that local loopback socket. This feature exists primarily to enable applications that listen on local loopback sockets as part of their functionality. Note that each customer's application sees a \"private\" loopback connection; application \"A\" cannot listen to a local loopback socket established by application \"B\".\n\nNamed pipes are also supported as an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism between different processes that collectively run a web app. For example, the IIS FastCGI module relies on named pipes to coordinate the individual processes that run PHP pages.\n\n\n<a id=\"Code\"></a>\n## Code Execution, Processes and Memory\nAs noted earlier, web apps run inside of low-privileged worker processes using a random application pool identity. Application code has access to the memory space associated with the worker process, as well as any child processes that may be spawned by CGI processes or other applications. However, one customer's web app cannot access the memory or data of another customer's web app even if it is on the same virtual machine.\n\nApplications can run scripts or pages written with supported web application development frameworks. Web Apps doesn't configure any web application framework settings to more restricted modes. For example, ASP.NET apps running on Web Apps run in \"full\" trust as opposed to a more restricted trust mode. Application frameworks, including both classic ASP and ASP.NET, can call in-process COM components (but not out of process COM components) like ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) that are registered by default on the Windows operating system.\n\nWeb applications can spawn and run arbitrary code. It is allowable for a web application to do things like spawn a command shell or run a PowerShell script. However, even though arbitrary code and processes can be spawned from a web application, executable programs and scripts are still restricted to the privileges granted to the parent application pool. For example, a web app can spawn an executable that makes an outbound HTTP call, but that same executable cannot attempt to unbind the IP address of a virtual machine from its NIC. Making an outbound network call is allowed to low-privileged code, but attempting to reconfigure network settings on a virtual machine requires administrative privileges.\n\n\n<a id=\"Diagnostics\"></a>\n## Diagnostics Logs and Events\nLog information is another set of data that some web applications attempt to access. The types of log information available to code running in Web Apps includes diagnostic and log information generated by a web app that is also easily accessible to a web app. \n\nFor example, W3C HTTP logs generated by an active web app are available either on a log directory in the network share location created for the web app, or available in blob storage if a customer has set up W3C logging to storage. The latter option enables large quantities of logs to be gathered without the risk of exceeding the file storage limits associated with a network share.\n\nIn a similar vein, real-time diagnostics information from .NET applications can also be logged using the .NET tracing and diagnostics infrastructure, with options to write the trace information to either the web app's network share, or alternatively to a blob storage location.\n\nAreas of diagnostics logging and tracing that aren't available to web applications on Azure are Windows ETW events, and common Windows event logs (e.g. System, Application and Security event logs). Since ETW trace information can potentially be viewable machine-wide (with the right ACLs), read and write access to ETW events are blocked. Developers might notice that API calls to read and write ETW events and common Windows event logs appear to work, but that is because WEb Apps is \"faking\" the calls so that they appear to succeed. In reality, the web app code has no access to this event data.\n\n<a id=\"RegistryAccess\"></a>\n## Registry Access\nApplications have read-only access to much (though not all) of the registry of the virtual machine they are running on. In practice, this means registry keys that allow read-only access to the local Users group are accessible by web applications. One area of the registry that is currently not supported for either read or write access is the HKEY\\_CURRENT\\_USER hive.\n\nWrite-access to the registry is blocked, including access to any per-user registry keys. From an application perspective, write access to the registry should never be relied upon in a cloud environment since applications can (and do) get migrated across different virtual machines. The only persistent writeable storage that can be depended on by a web application is the per-app content directory structure stored on the Web Apps UNC shares. \n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] If you want to get started with Azure App Service before signing up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751), where you can immediately create a short-lived starter web app in App Service.
