Additionally, for Azure SQL Indexers, there is new support for indexing geography points.\n\n- [Indexers Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.azure.search.models.indexer.aspx)\n- [DataSource Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.azure.search.models.datasource.aspx)\n\n##.NET SDK 0.9.6-preview\n**Released: 2015 March 5**\n\nThis is the first public release of the .NET SDK for Azure Search. It includes a client library, Microsoft.Azure.Search.dll, with two namespaces:\n\n- [Microsoft.Azure.Search](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.azure.search.aspx)\n- [Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.azure.search.models.aspx)\n\nExcludes:\n\n- [Indexers](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528173) (this feature is no longer excluded in the 0.10.0-preview version)\n- [Management REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn832684.aspx)\n- [2015-02-28-Preview](search-api-2015-02-28-Preview.md) features (currently, preview-only features consist of Microsoft natural language processors and `moreLikeThis`).\n\nVisit [How to use Azure Search in .NET](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528088) for guidance on installation and usage of the SDK.\n\n##Api-version 2015-02-28-Preview\n**Released: 2015 April 22**\n\n- Indexers now support fieldMapping constructs that provide field assignments when actual field names are different between the external database and the Azure Search index. See [Indexers](search-api-indexers-2015-02-28-Preview.md) for the `2015-02-28-preview` version of the indexers documentation..\n\n- Also in this preview update, indexers now support field type transformations so that you can map a string field in a SQL table to a string collection field in a search index, assuming the source field represents a JSON array.\n\n**Released: 2015 March 5**\n\n- [Microsoft natural language processors](search-api-2015-02-28-Preview.md) bring support for more languages and expansive stemming for all the languages supported by Office and Bing.\n\n- [moreLikeThis=](search-api-2015-02-28-Preview.md) is a search parameter, mutually exclusive of `search=`, that triggers an alternate query execution path. Instead of full-text search of `search=` based on a search term input, `moreLikeThis=` finds documents that are similar to a given document by comparing their searchable fields.\n\n##Api-version 2015-02-28\n**Released: 2015 March 5**\n\n- [Indexers](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=528210) is a new feature that vastly simplifies indexing from data sources on Azure SQL Database, Azure DocumentDB, and SQL Server on Azure VMs.\n\n- [Suggesters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798936.aspx) replaces the more limited, type-ahead query support of the previous implementation (it only matched on prefixes) by adding support for infix matching. This implementation can find matches anywhere in a term, and also supports fuzzy matching.\n\n- [Tag boosting](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528212) enables a new scenario for scoring profiles. In particular, it leverages persisted data (such as shopping preferences) so that you can boost search results for individual users, based on personalized information. \n\nVisit [Azure Search is now Generally Available](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528211) for the service announcement on the Azure blog that discusses all of these features.\n\n##Api-version 2014-10-20-Preview\n**Released: 2014 November, 2015 January**\n\n- [Lucene language analyzers](search-api-2014-10-20-preview.md) was added to provide multi-lingual support for the custom language analyzers distributed with Lucene. \n\n- Tool support was introduced for building indexes, including scoring profiles, in the [Azure management portal](https://portal.azure.com).\n\n##Api-version 2014-07-31-Preview\n**Released: 2014 August 21**\n\nThis version was the public preview release for Azure Search, providing the following core features:\n\n- REST API for index and document operations. The majority of this API version is intact in 2015-02-28. The documentation for version `2014-07-31-Preview` can be found at [Azure Search Service REST API Version 2014-07-31](search-api-2014-07-31-preview.md).\n\n- Scoring profiles for tuning search results. A scoring profile adds criteria used to compute search scores. The documentation for this feature can be found at [Azure Search Service Scoring Profiles REST API Version 2014-07-31](search-api-scoring-profiles-2014-07-31-preview.md).\n\n- Geospatial support has been available from the beginning, provided through the `Edm.GeographyPoint` data type that has been part of Azure Search since its inception.\n\n- Provisioning in the preview version of the [Azure management portal](https://portal.azure.com ). Azure Search was one of the few services that has only been available in the new portal.\n\n##Management api-version 2015-02-28\n**Released: 2015 March 5**\n\n[Management REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn832684.aspx) marks the first version of the management API belonging to the generally available release of Azure Search. There are no feature differences between the earlier preview and this one.\n\n##Management api-version 2014-07-31-Preview\n**Released: 2014 October**\n\nThe preview release of [Management REST API](search-management-api-2014-07-31-preview.md) was added to support service administration programmatically. It is versioned independently of the service REST API.\n\n\n "
