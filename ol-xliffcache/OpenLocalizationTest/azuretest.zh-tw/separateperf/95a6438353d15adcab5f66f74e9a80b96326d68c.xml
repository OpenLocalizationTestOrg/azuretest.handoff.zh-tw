For more information, see the [Key Vault pricing page](../../../../pricing/details/key-vault/).\n\n## Introduction\n\nAzure Key Vault helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. By using Key Vault, you can encrypt keys and secrets (such as authentication keys, storage account keys, data encryption keys, .PFX files, and passwords) by using keys that are protected by hardware security modules (HSMs). For added assurance, you can import or generate keys in HSMs (keys never leave the HSM boundary). The HSMs are FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated.  \n\nKey Vault streamlines the key management process and enables you to maintain control of keys that access and encrypt your data. Developers can create keys for development and testing in minutes, and then seamlessly migrate them to production keys. Security administrators can grant (and revoke) permission to keys, as needed. \n\nUse the following table to better understand how Key Vault can help to meet the needs of developers and security administrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Role        | Problem statement           | Solved by Azure Key Vault  |\n| ------------- |-------------|-----|\n| Developer for an Azure application      | “I want to write an application for Azure that uses keys for signing and encryption, but I want these to be external from my application so that the solution is suitable for an application that is geographically distributed. <br/><br/>I also want these keys and secrets to be protected, without having to write the code myself, and I want them to be easy for me to use from my applications, with optimal performance.” | √ Keys are stored in a vault and invoked by URI when needed.<br/><br/> √ Keys are safeguarded by Azure, using industry-standard algorithms, key lengths, and hardware security modules (HSMs).<br/><br/> √ Keys are processed in HSMs that reside in the same Azure datacenters as the applications, which provides better reliability and reduced latency than if the keys reside in a separate location, such as on-premises.|\n| Developer for Software as a Service (SaaS)      |“I don’t want the responsibility or potential liability for my customers’ tenant keys and secrets. <br/><br/>I want the customers to own and manage their keys so that I can concentrate on doing what I do best, which is providing the core software features.” | √ Customers can import their own keys into Azure, and manage them.
