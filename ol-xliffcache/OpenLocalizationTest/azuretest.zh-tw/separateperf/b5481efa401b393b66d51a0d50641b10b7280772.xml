If you want more flexibility over packages and assemblies, a WebJob would likely be a better option.\n\nUse the [JavaScript API App](app-service-logic-javascript-api.md) if you would prefer to write your expressions in JS.\n\n##Creating a C\\# API App\nTo use the C# API App, you need to first create an instance of the C# API app. This can be done either inline while creating a logic app or by selecting the C# API app from the Azure Marketplace.\n\n##Using C\\# API App in Logic Apps designer surface\n###Trigger\nYou can create a trigger that the Logic App service will poll (on an interval you define), and, if it returns anything other than `false`, the Logic App will run, otherwise, it will wait until the next polling interval to check again.\n\nThe inputs to the trigger are:\n- **C# Expression**  - An expression that will be evaluated. It will be invoked inside a function and must return `false` when you do not want the Logic app to run, and can return anything else when you want the Logic app to run. You will be able to use the content of the response in the actions of the Logic app.\n\nFor example, you could have a simple trigger that will only run your Logic app between the :15 and :30 of the hour:\n\n```\nvar d = new DateTime.Now; return (d.Minute > 15) && (d.Minute < 30);\n```\n\n###Action\n\nLikewise, you can provide an action to run. \n\nThe inputs to the action are:\n- **C# expression**  - An expression that will be evaluated. You must include the `return` statement to get any content. \n- **Context object(s)** - An optional context object that can be passed into the trigger. You can define as many properties as you want, but the base must be a JObject `{ ... }`, and objects can be referenced in the script via the key name (the value is passed in as a JToken cooresponding to name).\n- **Libraries** - An optional array of .dll files to include on compiling the script.  The array uses the following structure, and works best next to a blob storage connector with the .dll as the output:\n\n```javascript\n[{\"filename\": \"name.dll\", \"assembly\": {Base64StringFromConnector}, \"usingstatment\": \"using Library.Reference;\"}]\n```\n\nFor example, imagine you are using the Office 365 trigger **New Email**. That returns the following object:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    ...\n    \"Attachments\" : [\n        {\n            \"name\" : \"Picture.png\",\n            \"content\" : {\n                \"ContentData\" : \"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFAQMAAAC3obSmAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAGUExURf///wAAAFXC034AAAASSURBVAjXY2BgCGBgYOhgKAAABEIBSWDJEbYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\",\n                \"ContentType\" : \"image/png\",\n                \"ContentTransferEncoding\" : \"Base64\"\n            }\n        },  \n        {\n            \"name\" : \"File.txt\",\n            \"content\" : {\n                \"ContentData\" : \"Don't worry, be happy!\",\n                \"ContentType\" : \"text/plain\",\n                \"ContentTransferEncoding\" : \"None\"\n            }\n        }   \n    ]\n}\n```\n\nBut, you want to upload these attachments to a Yammer post. Unfortunately, the schema for Yammer attachments is slightly different. Now, you can now parse this inside your Logic app. For the context object just pass: `@triggerBody()`, and for the expression, pass:\n\n```javascript\nJArray YammerAttachments = new JObject();\nforeach(var obj in (JArray)Attachments)\n{\n    JObject att = new JObject();\n    att[\"Content\"] = obj[\"content\"];\n    att[\"FileName\"] = obj[\"Name\"];\n    YammerAttachments.Add(att); \n}\nreturn YammerAttachments;\n```\n\nThe action returns the object that you returned from your function in a results object. Thus, in the Yammer API app you can reference `@body('csapi').results` for the **Attachments** property.\n\n## Do more with your Connector\nNow that the connector is created, you can add it to a business flow using a Logic App. See [What are Logic Apps?](app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md).\n\nYou can also review performance statistics and control security to the connector. See [Manage  and Monitor API apps and connector](../app-service-api/app-service-api-manage-in-portal.md).\n\n<!--References -->\n\n<!--Links -->\n[Creating a Logic App]: app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md\n\ntest\n"
