There are many SSH client programs that you can choose from. The following are possible choices:\n\n- On a computer running a Windows operating system, you might want to use an SSH client such as PuTTY. For more information, see the [PuTTY Download Page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).\n- On a computer running a Linux operating system, you might want to use an SSH client such as OpenSSH. For more information, see [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.org/).\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] For more requirements and troubleshooting tips, see [Connect to an Azure virtual machine with RDP or SSH](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=398294).\n\nThis procedure shows you how to use the PuTTY program to access the virtual machine.\n\n1. Find the **Host Name** and **Port information** from the [Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com). You can find the information that you need from the dashboard of the virtual machine. Click the virtual machine name and look for the **SSH Details** in the **Quick Glance** section of the dashboard.\n\n    ![Obtain SSH details](./media/virtual-machines-linux-how-to-log-on/sshdetails.png)\n\n2. Open the PuTTY program.\n\n3. Enter the Host Name and the Port information that you collected from the dashboard, and then click **Open**.\n\n    ![Open PuTTY](./media/virtual-machines-linux-how-to-log-on/putty.png)\n\n4. Log on to the virtual machine using the account that you specified when the machine was created. For more details on how to create a virtual machine with user name and password, see [Create a Virtual Machine Running Linux](virtual-machines-linux-tutorial.md).\n\n    ![Log on to the virtual machine](./media/virtual-machines-linux-how-to-log-on/sshlogin.png)\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] The VMAccess extension can help you reset the SSH key or password if you've forgotten it.
