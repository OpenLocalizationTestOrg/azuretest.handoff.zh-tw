Even better, you can start working on one device and then seamlessly transition to a second device and pick up right where you left off. To get started you need to download the appropriate client for your device and sign in to the service.\n\nIn this topic, we'll review the clients currently supported and how to download them before I show you how to sign in to RemoteApp from each of the clients.\n\n## Supported clients\n\nYou can access RemoteApp using the steps below if your device is running one of these operating systems:\n\n - Windows 10 preview\n - Windows 8.1\n - Windows 8\n - Windows 7 Service Pack 1\n - Windows RT\n - Windows Phone 8.1\n - iOS\n - Mac OS X\n - Android\n\n\n What about thin clients? The following Windows Embedded thin clients are supported:\n\n - Windows Embedded Standard 7 with Service Pack 1\n - Windows Embedded POSReady7\n - Windows Embedded Thin PC\n - Windows Embedded 8.1 Industry\n\n## Downloading the client\n\nNo matter what platform you are using, the client you need to access RemoteApp can be found on the [Remote Desktop client download](https://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.com/ClientDownload/AllClients.aspx) page.\n\nClicking the different links will either directly start downloading the client or will send you to the client download page in the app store for that platform. Install the client by following the instructions on the screen.\n\nOnce you have installed the client on your device and launched it, jump to the corresponding section below to learn how to sign in to RemoteApp from that client.\n\n## Android\n\nOnce you have installed the Microsoft Remote Desktop app from the Google Play store, you can find it in your app list under **Remote Desktop**.\n\n1. Launching the app brings you to an empty Connection Center, unless you've already been using the app. To get started with Azure RemoteApp, tap the add button **\"\"+\"\"** and tap **Azure RemoteApp**. \n\n     ![Empty Connection Center](./media/remoteapp-clients/Android1.png)\n\n2. You need to sign in with your email address to access the service. Tap **Get started**.\n\n    ![Sign in prompt](./media/remoteapp-clients/Android2.png)\n\n3. On the next page, type in your **email address** and tap **Continue**. This begins the sign-in process using Azure Active Directory.\n\n    ![First Azure Active Directory page](./media/remoteapp-clients/Android3.png)\n\n4. Follow the instructions on the screen to sign in with your Microsoft account (previously called \"LiveID\") or organization ID. Once signed in, you may be presented with a page listing all the invitations you have received. If you are, select the invitations you trust and tap **Done**. \n\n    ![Invitations page](./media/remoteapp-clients/Android4.png)\n\n5. After accepting your invitations, the list of apps you have access to will be downloaded to your device and made available in the Connection Center. Tap one of the apps to start using it.\n\n    ![Connection Center with a feed](./media/remoteapp-clients/Android5.png)\n\n6. If you do not have an invitation yet, you can still try out the service. To do so, tap **Go to free trial** when prompted.\n\n    ![Demo feed prompt](./media/remoteapp-clients/Android6.png)\n\n7.
