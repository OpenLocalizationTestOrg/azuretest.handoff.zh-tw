This will bring up a report similar to the one below. You can also click Export to CSV if you wish to export the report.\n\n<center>![Cloud](./media/multi-factor-authentication-whats-next/report.png)</center>\n\n## Custom voice messages\n\nCustom voice messages allow you to use your own recordings or greetings with multi-factor authentication.  These can be used in addition to or to replace the Microsoft records.\n\nBefore you begin be aware of the following:\n\n- The current supported file formats are .wav and .mp3.\n- The file size limit is 5MB.\n- It is recommended that for Authentication messages that it be no longer than 20 seconds. Anything greater than this could cause the verification to fail because the user may not respond before the message finishes and the verification times out.\n\n\n\n### To setup custom voice messages in Azure Multi-Factor Authentication\n<ol>\n<li>Create a custom voice message using one of the supported file formats. See Custom Voice Message Recommendations below.</li>\n<li>Log on to [http://azure.microsoft.com](http://azure.microsoft.com)</li>\n<li>On the left, select Active Directory.</li>\n<li>At the top select Multi-Factor Auth Providers.

You will see a message that says you have successfully created a voice message.</li>\n\n<center>![Cloud](./media/multi-factor-authentication-whats-next/custom5.png)</center>\n\n\n## Caching in Azure Multi-Factor Authentication\n\nCaching allows you to set a specific time period so that subsequent authentication attempts succeed automatically.  This allows your users to avoid having to wait for phone calls or text if they authenticate within this time period.\n\n\n\n### To setup caching in Azure Multi-Factor Authentication\n<ol>\n\n1. Log on to [http://azure.microsoft.com](http://azure.microsoft.com)\n2. On the left, select Active Directory.\n3. At the top select Multi-Factor Auth Providers. This will bring up a list of your Multi-Factor Auth Providers.\n4. If you have more than one Multi-Factor Auth Provider, select the one you wish to enable fraud alerting on and click Manage at the bottom of the page. If you have only one, just click Manage. This will open the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Management Portal.\n5. On the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Management Portal, on the left, click Caching.\n6. On the Configure caching page click New Cache\n7. Select the Cache type and the cache seconds.  Click create.\n\n\n<center>![Cloud](./media/multi-factor-authentication-whats-next/cache.png)</center>\n\n## Trusted IPs\n\nTrusted IPs is a feature of multi-factor authentication that allows administrators of a managed or federated tenant the ability to bypass multi-factor authentication for users that are signing in from the companyâ€™s local intranet. The features are available for Azure AD tenants that have Azure AD Premium, Enterprise Mobility Suite or Azure Multi-Factor Authentication licenses.\n\n \nType of Azure AD Tenant| Available Trusted IP options\n:------------- | :------------- | \nManaged|Specific IP address ranges â€“ Administrators can specify a range of IP addresses that can bypass multi-factor authentication for users that are signing in from the companyâ€™s intranet..\nFederated|<li>All Federated Users - All federated users who are signing-in from inside the organization will bypass multi-factor authentication using a claim issued by AD FS.</li><li>Specific IP address ranges â€“ Administrators can specify a range of IP addresses that can bypass multi-factor authentication for users that are signing in from the companyâ€™s intranet.\n\nThis bypass only works from inside a companyâ€™s intranet. So for example, if you only selected all federated users, and a user signs in from outside the companyâ€™s intranet, that user will have to authenticate using multi-factor authentication even if the user presents an AD FS claim.

To use these apps, you'll need to use \"app passwords\" in place of your traditional password.  The app password allows the application to bypass multi-factor authentication and continue working.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] Modern Authentication for the Office 2013 Clients\n>\n> Office 2013 clients (including Outlook) now support new Authentication Protocols and can be enabled to support Multi-Factor Authentication.  This means that once enabled, app passwords are not required for use with Office 2013 clients.  For more information see [Office 2013 modern authentication public preview announced](https://blogs.office.com/2015/03/23/office-2013-modern-authentication-public-preview-announced/).\n\n\n\n### Important things to know about app passwords\n\nThe following is an important list of things that you should know about app passwords.\n\nAuthentication Experience|For browser based apps|For non-browser based apps\n:------------- | :------------- | :------------- \n|<ul><li>The 1st factor of authentication is performed on-premises</li><li>The 2nd factor is a phone based method carried out by Cloud Identity.</li>|<ul><li>Admins and users can use app passwords to sign-in.\n\n- Users can have multiple app passwords which increases the surface area for theft. Since app passwords are hard to remember, it might encourage people to write this down. This is not recommended and should be discouraged because only one factor is required to login with app password.\n- Apps which cache passwords and use it in on-premise scenarios might start failing since the app password will not be known outside of the organizational id. An example is Exchange emails that are on-premise but the archived mail is in the cloud. The same password will not work.\n- The actual password is automatically generated and is not supplied by the user. This is because the automatically generated password, is harder for an attacker to guess and is more secure.\n- Currently there is a limit of 40 passwords per user. You will be prompted to delete told to delete one of your existing app passwords in order to create a new one.\n- Once multi-factor authentication is enabled on a user's account, app passwords can be used with most non-browser clients such as Outlook and Lync, but administrative actions cannot be performed using app passwords through non-browser applications such as Windows PowerShell even if that user has an administrative account.  Ensure you create a service account with a strong password to run PowerShell scripts and do not enable that account for multi-factor authentication.\n\n>[AZURE.WARNING]  App passwords will not work in hybrid environments where clients communicate with both on-premises and cloud autodiscover endpoints.\n>\n>Please be aware that app passwords will not work in hybrid environments where clients communicate with both on-premises and cloud autodiscover endpoints since domain passwords are required to authenticate on-premises and app passwords are required to authenticate with the cloud.\n\n\n### Naming Guidance for App Passwords\nIt is recommended that app password names should reflect the device on which they will be used. For instance, if you have a laptop that has non-browser apps such as Outlook, Word, and Excel, you only need to create one app password named Laptop and use that app password in all of these applications. Although you can create separate passwords for all of these applications, it is not recommended. The recommend way is to use one app password per device.\n\n\n<center>![Cloud](./media/multi-factor-authentication-whats-next/naming.png)</center>\n\n\n### Federated (SSO) App Passwords\nAzure AD supports federation with on-premises Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). If your organization is federated(SSO) with Azure AD and you are going to be using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, then the following is important information that you should be aware when using app passwords. This applies only to federated(SSO) customers.\n\n- The App Password is verified by Azure AD and hence bypasses federation. Federation is only actively used when setting up App Password.\n- For federated(SSO) users, we will never go to the Identity Provider (IdP) unlike the passive flow. The passwords will be stored in the organizational id. If the user leaves the company, that info has to flow to organizational id using DirSync in real time. Account disable/deletion may take up to 3 hours to sync, delaying disable/deletion of App Password in Azure AD.\n- On-premises Client Access Control settings are not honored by App Password\n- No on-premises authentication logging / auditing capability is available for App Password\n- More end-user education is required for the Microsoft Lync 2013 client. For the required steps, see How to change the password in your email to the app password.\n- Certain advanced architectural designs may require using a combination of organizational username and passwords and app passwords when using multi-factor authentication with clients, depending on where they authenticate. For clients that authenticate against an on-premise infrastructure, you would use an organizational username and password. For clients that authenticate against Azure AD, you would use the app password.\n\nFor example, suppose you have an architecture that consists of the following:\n\n- You are federating your on-premise instance of Active Directory with Azure AD\n- You are using Exchange online\n- You are using Lync that is specifically on-premise\n- You are using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication\n\n\n<center>![Proofup](./media/multi-factor-authentication-whats-next/federated.png)</center>\n\n In these instances, you must do the following:\n\n- When signing-in to Lync, use your organizationsâ€™ username and password.\n- When attempting to access the address book via an Outlook client that connects to Exchange online, use an app password.\n\n### Allowing app password creation\nBy default, users cannot create app passwords.  This feature must be enabled.  To allow users the ability to create app passwords use the following procedure.\n\n#### To enable users to create app passwords\n\n\n\n1. Sign-in to the Azure Management Portal.\n2. On the left, click Active Directory.\n3. Under, Directory click on the directory for the user you wish to enable.\n4. At the top, click Users.\n5.

It is a free feature for all MFA users and enhances the usability for the users. However, since the users are allowed to suspend MFA, this feature may reduce account security. \n\nTo ensure that the user accounts are secured, you should restore Multi-Factor Authentication for their devices for either of the following scenarios: \n\n- If their corporate account has become compromised\n- If a remembered device is lost or stolen\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] This feature is implemented as a browser cookie cache. It will not work if your browser cookies are not enabled.\n\n### How to enable/disable Suspend MFA for remembered devices and set\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sign-in to the Azure Management Portal.</li>\n<li>On the left, click Active Directory.</li>\n<li>Under Active Directory, click on the directory you wish to setup Suspend Multi-Factor Authentication for remembered devices on.</li>\n<li>On the Directory you have selected, click Configure.</li>\n<li>In the multi-factor authentication section, click Manage service settings.</li>\n<li>On the Service Settings page, under manage user device settings, select/unselect the **Allow users to suspend multi-factor authentication by causing a device to be remembered**.</li>\n![Suspend devices](./media/multi-factor-authentication-manage-users-and-devices/suspend.png)\n<li>Set the number of days that you want to allow the suspension.
