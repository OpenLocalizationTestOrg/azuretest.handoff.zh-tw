Once collected into Event Hubs, you can transform and store data using any real-time analytics provider or storage cluster.\n\nFor more information, please see the [Event Hubs overview].\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to ingest messages into an Event Hub using a console application in C#, and to retrieve them in parallel using Apache Storm.\n\nIn order to complete this tutorial you will need the following:\n\n+ Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows\n\n+ A Java development environment configured to run [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). For this tutorial, we will assume [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)\n\n+ An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes.

On the same page, take note of the generated keys for **ReceiveRule**.\n\n    ![][6c]\n\n8. Click the **Dashboard** tab at the top, and then click **Connection Information**.
