Virtual hard disks are processed one by one till all the disks are uploaded to Azure. This normally takes a while to complete based on the disk size and the bandwidth. Refer [How to manage on-premises to Azure protection network bandwidth usage](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3056159) for optimizing your network usage. Once initial replication completes *Finalize protection on the virtual machine* job configures the network and post-replication settings. While Initial Replication is in-progress all the changes to the disks gets tracked as mentioned in Delta Replication section below. Additional disk storage will be consumed for the snapshot and HRL files while Initial Replication is in-progress. On completion of an Initial Replication, Hyper-V VM snapshot will be deleted which results in merging data changes post Initial Replication to the parent disk.\n\n![Troubleshoot on-premises Hyper-V issues](media/site-recovery-understanding-site-to-azure-protection/image03.png)\n\n### Delta Replication\nHyper-V Replica Replication Tracker, which is part of the Hyper-V Replica Replication Engine, tracks the changes to a virtual hard disk as Hyper-V Replication Logs (*.hrl). HRL files will be located in the same directory as of the associated disks. Each disk configured for replication will have an associated HRL file. This log(s) is (are) sent to the customer's storage account after initial replication is complete. When a log is in transit to the Azure, the changes in the primary are tracked in another log file in the same directory.\n\nVM replication health during Initial Replication or Delta Replication can be monitored in the VM view as mentioned under [Monitor replication health for virtual machine](./site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting.md#monitor-replication-health-for-virtual-machine).  \n\n### Re-synchronization \nA virtual machine is marked for re-synchronization when both Delta Replication fails and Full Initial Replication is costly in terms of network bandwidth or the time it would take to complete a Full Initial Replication. For example when HRL file-size piles up to 50% of the total disk size then the virtual machine is marked for re-synchronization. Re-synchronization minimizes the amount of data sent over the network by computing check-sums of the Source and Target virtual machine disks and sending only the differential. \n\nAfter re-synchronization completes, normal Delta Replication should resume. Re-synchronization can be resumed in the event of an outage (e.g. network outage, VMMS crash, etc.). \n\nBy default *Automatically scheduled re-synchronization* is configured during the non-office work hours. If the virtual machine needs to be re-synchronized manually, select the virtual machine from the portal and click RESYNCHRONIZE.\n![Troubleshoot on-premises Hyper-V issues](media/site-recovery-understanding-site-to-azure-protection/image04.png)\n\nRe-synchronization uses a fixed-block chunking algorithm where Source and Target files are divided into fixed chunks; check-sum for each chunk are generated and then compared to determine which block(s) from the Source need to be applied to the Target. \n\n### Retry logic\nThere is built-in retry logic when replication errors occur. This can be classified into two categories as below.\n\n| Category                  | Scenarios                                    |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Non-Recoverable Error     | No retry will be attempted. Virtual machine replication status will be shown as Critical and an administrator intervention is required. Examples would include <ul><li>A broken VHD chain</li><li>Replica virtual machine is in an invalid state</li><li>Network authentication error</li><li>Authorization Error</li><li>If a virtual machine isn't found in the case of a standalone Hyper-V server</li></ul>|\n| Recoverable Error         | Retries occur every replication interval using exponentially backoff which increases the retry interval from the start of first attempt (1, 2, 4, 8, 10 minutes). If an error persists, retry every 30 minutes. Examples would include <ul><li>Network Error</li><li>Low disk space</li><li>Low memory condition</li></ul>|\n\n## Understanding Hyper-V virtual machine protection and recovery life cycle\n\n![Understanding the Hyper-V virtual machine protection & recovery life cycle](media/site-recovery-understanding-site-to-azure-protection/image05.png)\n\n## Other references\n\n- [Monitor and troubleshoot protection for VMware, VMM, Hyper-V and Physical sites](./site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting.md)\n- [Reaching out for Microsoft Support](./site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting.md#reaching-out-for-microsoft-support)\n- [Common ASR errors and their resolutions](./site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting.md#common-asr-errors-and-their-resolutions)"
