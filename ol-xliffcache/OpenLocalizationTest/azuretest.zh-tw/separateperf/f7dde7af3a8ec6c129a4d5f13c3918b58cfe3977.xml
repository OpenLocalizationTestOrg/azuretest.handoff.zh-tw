Azure portal and CLI support will be provided in an upcoming release.\nThis article walks you through the steps to create and configure, start, and delete an Application Gateway.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n1. Install the latest version of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets using the Web Platform Installer. You can download and install the latest version from the **Windows PowerShell** section of the [Download page](http://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).\n2. Verify that you have a working virtual network with a valid subnet.\n3. Verify that you have backend servers either in the virtual network, or with an assigned public IP/VIP.\n\n\nTo create a new Application Gateway, perform the following steps in the order listed.\n\n1. [Create a new Application Gateway](#create-a-new-application-gateway)\n2. [Configure the gateway](#configure-the-gateway)\n3. [Set the gateway configuration](#set-the-gateway-configuration)\n4. [Start the gateway](#start-the-gateway)\n4. [Verify the gateway status](#verify-the-gateway-status)\n\nIf you want to delete an Application Gateway, see [Delete an Application Gateway](#delete-an-application-gateway).\n\n## Create a new Application Gateway\n\nTo create the gateway, use the `New-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet, replacing the values with your own. Note that billing for the gateway does not start at this point. Billing begins in a later step, when the gateway is successfully started.\n\nThe following example shows the cmdlet on the first line followed by the output.\n\n    PS C:\\> New-AzureApplicationGateway -Name AppGwTest -VnetName testvnet1 -Subnets @(\"Subnet-1\")\n\n    VERBOSE: 4:31:35 PM - Begin Operation: New-AzureApplicationGateway\n    VERBOSE: 4:32:37 PM - Completed Operation: New-AzureApplicationGateway\n    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error\n    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----\n    Successful OK                   55ef0460-825d-2981-ad20-b9a8af41b399\n\nTo validate that the gateway was created, you can use the `Get-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet.\n\nIn the sample, *Description*, *InstanceCount*, and *GatewaySize* are optional parameters. The default value for *InstanceCount* is 2, with a maximum value of 10. The default value for *GatewaySize* is Medium. Small and Large are other available values. *Vip* and *DnsName* are shown as blank because the gateway has not started yet. These will be created once the gateway is in the running state.\n\n\n\n\n    PS C:\\> Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest\n    Name          : AppGwTest\n    Description   :\n    VnetName      : testvnet1\n    Subnets       : {Subnet-1}\n    InstanceCount : 2\n    GatewaySize   : Medium\n    State         : Stopped\n    VirtualIPs    : {}\n    DnsName       :\n\n\n## Configure the gateway\n\nAn Application Gateway configuration consists of multiple values. The values can be tied together to construct the configuration.\n\nThe values are:\n\n- **Backend server pool:** The list of IP addresses of the backend servers. The IP addresses listed should either belong to the VNet subnet, or should be a public IP/VIP.\n- **Backend server pool settings:** Every pool has settings like port, protocol, and cookie-based affinity. These settings are tied to a pool and are applied to all servers within the pool.\n- **Frontend Port:** This port is the public port opened on the Application Gateway. Traffic hits this port, and then gets redirected to one of the backend servers.\n- **Listener:** The listener has a front end port, a protocol (Http or Https, these are case-sensitive), and the SSL certificate name (if configuring SSL offload).\n- **Rule:** The rule binds the listener and the backend server pool, and defines which backend server pool the traffic should be directed to when it hits a particular listener. Currently, only the *basic* rule is supported. The *basic* rule is round-robin load distribution.\n\nYou can construct your configuration either by creating a configuration object, or by using a configuration XML file.\nTo construct your configuration by using a configuration XML file, use the following sample.\n\n **Configuration XML sample**\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n    <ApplicationGatewayConfiguration xmlns:i=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/windowsazure\">\n        <FrontendPorts>\n            <FrontendPort>\n                <Name>FrontendPort1</Name>\n                <Port>80</Port>\n            </FrontendPort>\n        </FrontendPorts>\n        <BackendAddressPools>\n            <BackendAddressPool>\n                <Name>BackendPool1</Name>\n                <IPAddresses>\n                    <IPAddress>10.0.0.1</IPAddress>\n                    <IPAddress>10.0.0.2</IPAddress>\n                </IPAddresses>\n            </BackendAddressPool>\n        </BackendAddressPools>\n        <BackendHttpSettingsList>\n            <BackendHttpSettings>\n                <Name>BackendSetting1</Name>\n                <Port>80</Port>\n                <Protocol>Http</Protocol>\n                <CookieBasedAffinity>Enabled</CookieBasedAffinity>\n            </BackendHttpSettings>\n        </BackendHttpSettingsList>\n        <HttpListeners>\n            <HttpListener>\n                <Name>HTTPListener1</Name>\n                <FrontendPort>FrontendPort1</FrontendPort>\n                <Protocol>Http</Protocol>\n            </HttpListener>\n        </HttpListeners>\n        <HttpLoadBalancingRules>\n            <HttpLoadBalancingRule>\n                <Name>HttpLBRule1</Name>\n                <Type>basic</Type>\n                <BackendHttpSettings>BackendSetting1</BackendHttpSettings>\n                <Listener>HTTPListener1</Listener>\n                <BackendAddressPool>BackendPool1</BackendAddressPool>\n            </HttpLoadBalancingRule>\n        </HttpLoadBalancingRules>\n    </ApplicationGatewayConfiguration>\n\n## Set the gateway configuration\n\nNext, you'll set the Application Gateway. You can use the `Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig` cmdlet with a configuration object, or with a configuration XML file.\n\n\n    PS C:\\> Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig -Name AppGwTest -ConfigFile D:\\config.xml\n\n    VERBOSE: 7:54:59 PM - Begin Operation: Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig\n    VERBOSE: 7:55:32 PM - Completed Operation: Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig\n    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error\n    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----\n    Successful OK                   9b995a09-66fe-2944-8b67-9bb04fcccb9d\n\n## Start the gateway\n\nOnce the gateway has been configured, use the `Start-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet to start the gateway. Billing for an Application Gateway begins after the gateway has been successfully started.\n\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The `Start-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet might take up to 15-20 minutes to complete.\n\n\n\n    PS C:\\> Start-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest\n\n    VERBOSE: 7:59:16 PM - Begin Operation: Start-AzureApplicationGateway\n    VERBOSE: 8:05:52 PM - Completed Operation: Start-AzureApplicationGateway\n    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error\n    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----\n    Successful OK                   fc592db8-4c58-2c8e-9a1d-1c97880f0b9b\n\n## Verify the gateway status\n\nUse the `Get-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet to check the status of the gateway. If *Start-AzureApplicationGateway* succeeded in the previous step, the State should be *Running*, and the Vip and DnsName should have valid entries.\n\nThe following example shows an Application Gateway that is up, running, and ready to take traffic destined to `http://<generated-dns-name>.cloudapp.net`.\n\n    PS C:\\> Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest\n\n    VERBOSE: 8:09:28 PM - Begin Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGateway\n    VERBOSE: 8:09:30 PM - Completed Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGateway\n    Name          : AppGwTest\n    Description   :\n    VnetName      : testvnet1\n    Subnets       : {Subnet-1}\n    InstanceCount : 2\n    GatewaySize   : Medium\n    State         : Running\n    Vip           : 138.91.170.26\n    DnsName       : appgw-1b8402e8-3e0d-428d-b661-289c16c82101.cloudapp.net\n\n\n## Delete an Application Gateway\n\nTo delete an Application Gateway:\n\n1. Use the `Stop-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet to stop the gateway.\n2. Use the `Remove-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet to remove the gateway.\n3. Verify the gateway has been removed by using the `Get-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet.\n\nThe following example shows the `Stop-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet on the first line, followed by the output.\n\n    PS C:\\> Stop-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest\n\n    VERBOSE: 9:49:34 PM - Begin Operation: Stop-AzureApplicationGateway\n    VERBOSE: 10:10:06 PM - Completed Operation: Stop-AzureApplicationGateway\n    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error\n    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----\n    Successful OK                   ce6c6c95-77b4-2118-9d65-e29defadffb8\n\nOnce the Application Gateway is in a Stopped state, use the `Remove-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet to remove the service.\n\n\n    PS C:\\> Remove-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest\n\n    VERBOSE: 10:49:34 PM - Begin Operation: Remove-AzureApplicationGateway\n    VERBOSE: 10:50:36 PM - Completed Operation: Remove-AzureApplicationGateway\n    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error\n    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----\n    Successful OK                   055f3a96-8681-2094-a304-8d9a11ad8301\n\nTo verify that the service has been removed, you can use the `Get-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet. This step is not required.\n\n\n    PS C:\\> Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest\n\n    VERBOSE: 10:52:46 PM - Begin Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGateway\n\n    Get-AzureApplicationGateway : ResourceNotFound: The gateway does not exist.\n    .....\n\n## Next steps\n\nIf you want to configure SSL offload, see [Configure Application Gateway for SSL offload](application-gateway-ssl.md).\n\nIf you want to configure an Application Gateway to use with ILB, see [Create an Application Gateway with an Internal Load Balancer (ILB)](application-gateway-ilb.md).\n\nIf you want more information about load balancing options in general, see:\n\n- [Azure Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/load-balancer/)\n- [Azure Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/traffic-manager/)\n\ntest\n"
