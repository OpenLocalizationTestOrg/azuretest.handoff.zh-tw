You can also manage other objects on the server that are part of Media Services, including jobs, tasks, access policies, locators, and more.\n\nThe following example shows how to query for an asset by assetId. \n\n    static IAsset GetAsset(string assetId)\n    {\n        // Use a LINQ Select query to get an asset.\n        var assetInstance =\n            from a in _context.Assets\n            where a.Id == assetId\n            select a;\n        // Reference the asset as an IAsset.\n        IAsset asset = assetInstance.FirstOrDefault();\n    \n        return asset;\n    }\n\nTo list all assets available on the server, you can use the following method which iterates through the assets collection, and display details about each asset.\n    \n    static void ListAssets()\n    {\n        string waitMessage = \"Building the list. This may take a few \"\n            + \"seconds to a few minutes depending on how many assets \"\n            + \"you have.\"\n            + Environment.NewLine + Environment.NewLine\n            + \"Please wait...\"\n            + Environment.NewLine;\n        Console.Write(waitMessage);\n    \n        // Create a Stringbuilder to store the list that we build. \n        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\n    \n        foreach (IAsset asset in _context.Assets)\n        {\n            // Display the collection of assets.\n            builder.AppendLine(\"\");\n            builder.AppendLine(\"******ASSET******\");\n            builder.AppendLine(\"Asset ID: \" + asset.Id);\n            builder.AppendLine(\"Name: \" + asset.Name);\n            builder.AppendLine(\"==============\");\n            builder.AppendLine(\"******ASSET FILES******\");\n    \n            // Display the files associated with each asset. \n            foreach (IAssetFile fileItem in asset.AssetFiles)\n            {\n                builder.AppendLine(\"Name: \" + fileItem.Name);\n                builder.AppendLine(\"Size: \" + fileItem.ContentFileSize);\n                builder.AppendLine(\"==============\");\n            }\n        }\n    \n        // Display output in console.\n        Console.Write(builder.ToString());\n    }\n\nThe following code snippet deletes all the assets from the Media Services account. Note, if an asset is associated with a program, you first must delete the program.\n\n    foreach (IAsset asset in _context.Assets)\n    {\n        asset.Delete();\n    }\n\n \ntest\n"
