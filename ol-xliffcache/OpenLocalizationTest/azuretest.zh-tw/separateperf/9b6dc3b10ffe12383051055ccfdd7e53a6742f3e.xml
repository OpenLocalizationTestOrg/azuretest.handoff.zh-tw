You'll need to paste this into your project in Eclipse.\n\n    ![In the new resource overview, click Properties and copy the Instrumentation Key](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/03-key.png)\n\n## Add the SDK to your Java project\n\n1. Add Application Insights from the context menu of your web project.\n\n    ![In the new resource overview, click Properties and copy the Instrumentation Key](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/4-addai.png)\n2. Paste the instrumentation key that you got from the Azure portal.\n\n    ![In the new resource overview, click Properties and copy the Instrumentation Key](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/5-config.png)\n\n\nThe key is sent along with every item of telemetry and tells Application Insights to display it in your resource.\n\n## Run the application and see metrics\n\nRun your application.\n\nReturn to your Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure.\n\nHTTP requests data will appear on the overview blade. (If it isn't there, wait a few seconds and then click Refresh.)\n\n![Server response, request counts, and failures ](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/5-results.png)\n \n\nClick through any chart to see more detailed metrics. \n\n![Request counts by name](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/6-barchart.png)\n\n\n[Learn more about metrics.][metrics]\n\n \n\nAnd when viewing the properties of a request, you can see the telemetry events associated with it such as requests and exceptions.\n \n![All traces for this request](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/7-instance.png)\n\n\n## Client-side telemetry\n\nFrom the QuickStart blade, click Get code to monitor my web pages: \n\n![On your app overview blade, choose Quick Start, Get code to monitor my web pages. Copy the script.](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/02-monitor-web-page.png)\n\nInsert the code snippet in the head of your HTML files.\n\n#### View client-side data\n\nOpen your updated web pages and use them. Wait a minute or two, then return to Application Insights and refresh the usage blade.\n\nPage view, user, and session metrics will appear on the usage blade:\n\n![Sessions, users and page views](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/appinsights-47usage-2.png)\n\n[Learn more about setting up client-side telemetry.][usage]\n\n## Availability web tests\n\nApplication Insights can test your website at regular intervals to check that it's up and responding well. To set up, click through the empty web tests chart on the overview blade, and provide your public URL. \n\nYou'll get charts of response times, plus email notifications if your site goes down.\n\n![Web test example](./media/app-insights-java-eclipse/appinsights-10webtestresult.png)\n\n[Learn more about availability web tests.][availability] \n\n## Diagnostic logs\n\nIf you're using Logback or Log4J (v1.2 or v2.0) for tracing, you can have your trace logs sent automatically to Application Insights where you can explore and search on them.\n\n[Learn more about diagnostic logs][javalogs]\n\n## Custom telemetry \n\nInsert a few lines of code in your Java web application to find out what users are doing with it or to help diagnose problems. \n\nYou can insert code both in web page JavaScript and in the server-side Java.\n\n[Learn about custom telemetry][track]\n\n\n\n## Next steps\n\n#### Detect and diagnose issues\n\n* [Add web client telemetry][usage] to get performance telemetry from the web client.\n* [Set up web tests][availability] to make sure your application stays live and responsive.\n* [Search events and logs][diagnostic] to help diagnose problems.\n* [Capture Log4J or Logback traces][javalogs]\n\n#### Track usage\n\n* [Add web client telemetry][usage] to monitor page views and basic user metrics.\n* [Track custom events and metrics][track] to learn about how your application is used, both at the client and the server.\n\n\n<!--Link references-->\n\n[availability]: app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability.md\n[diagnostic]: app-insights-diagnostic-search.md\n[java]: app-insights-java-get-started.md\n[javalogs]: app-insights-java-trace-logs.md\n[metrics]: app-insights-metrics-explorer.md\n[track]: app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md\n[usage]: app-insights-web-track-usage.md\n\n \ntest\n"
