The following sections discuss authentication tokens. \n- When a client requests to stream the video, the content is dynamically encrypted with **Common Encryption** (CENC) and dynamically packaged by AMS to Smooth Streaming and DASH. We also deliver PlayReady M2TS elementary stream encryption for HLS streaming protocol.\n- PlayReady license is retrieved from AMS license server and Widevine license is retrieved from castLabs license server. \n- Media Player automatically decides which license to fetch based on the client platform capability. \n\n##Authentication token generation for getting a license\n\nBoth castLabs and AMS support JWT (JSON Web Token) token format used to authorize a license. \n\n###JWT token in AMS \n\nThe following table describes JWT token in AMS. \n\nIssuer|Issuer string from the chosen Secure Token Service (STS)\n---|---\nAudience|Audience string from the used STS\nClaims|A set of claims\nNotBefore|Start validity of the token\nExpires|End validity of the token\nSigningCredentials|The key that is shared among PlayReady License Server, castLabs License Server and STS, it could be either symmetric or asymmetric key.\n\n###JWT token in castLabs\n\nThe following table describes JWT token in castLabs. \n\nName|Description\n---|---\noptData|A JSON string containing information about you. \ncrt|A JSON string containing information about the asset, its license info and playback rights.\niat|The current datetime in epoch.\njti|A unique identifier about this token (every token can only be used once in the castLabs system).\n\n##Sample solution set up \n\nThe [sample solution](https://github.com/AzureMediaServicesSamples/CastlabsIntegration) consists of two projects:\n\n-   A console app that can be used to set DRM restrictions on an already ingested asset, for both PlayReady and Widevine.\n-   A Web Application that hands out tokens, which could be seen as a VERY SIMPLIFIED version of an STS.\n\n\nTo use the console application:\n\n1.  Change the app.config to setup AMS credentials, castLabs credentials, STS configuration and shared key.\n2.  Upload an Asset into AMS.\n3.  Get the UUID from the uploaded Asset, and change Line 32 in the Program.cs file:\n\n         var objIAsset = _context.Assets.Where(x => x.Id == \"nb:cid:UUID:dac53a5d-1500-80bd-b864-f1e4b62594cf\").FirstOrDefault();\n\n4.  Use an AssetId for naming the asset in the castLabs system (Line 44 in the Program.cs file).\n\n    You must set AssetId for **castLabs**; it needs to be a unique alphanumeric string.\n\n5.  Run the program.\n\n\nTo use the Web Application (STS):\n\n1.  Change the web.config to setup castlabs merchant ID, the STS configuration and the shared key.\n2.  Deploy to Azure Websites.\n3.  Navigate to the website.\n\n##Playing back a video\n\nTo playback a video encrypted with common encryption (PlayReady), you can use the [Azure Media Player](http://amsplayer.azurewebsites.net/azuremediaplayer.html). When running the console app, the Content Key ID and the Manifest URL are echoed.\n\n1.  Open a new tab and launch your STS: http://[yourStsName].azurewebsites.net/api/token/assetid/[yourCastLabsAssetId]/contentkeyid/[thecontentkeyid].\n2.  Go to [Azure Media Player](http://amsplayer.azurewebsites.net/azuremediaplayer.html).\n3.  Paste in the streaming URL.\n4.  Click the **Advanced Options** checkbox.\n5.  Select PlayReady in the **Protection** dropdown.\n6.  Paste the token that you got from your STS in the Token textbox.\n7.  Update the player.\n8.  The video should be playing.\n\nFor playing back the protected video in HTML5 with Chrome with the castLabs player, please contact yanmf@microsoft.com to get access to the player. When you have access, there are 2 things to be aware of:\n\n1.  The castLabs player needs access to the MPEG-DASH manifest file, so append (format=mpd-time-csf) to your manifest file to get the MPEG-DASH manifest file, instead of the default Smooth Streaming one.\n\n2.  The castLab license server does not need the “Bearer=” prefix in front of the token. So please remove that before submitting the token.\n\n \n\ntest\n"
