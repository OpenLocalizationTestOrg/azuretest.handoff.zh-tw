If this is your first experience with Mobile Services, consider first completing the tutorial <a href=\"/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-android\">Get started with Mobile Services</a>.</p>\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need the following:\n\n- an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AED8DE357\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Free Trial</a>.\n\n\n- the [Azure Mobile Services Android SDK]; \n- the <a  href=\"https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Android Studio integrated development environment</a>, which includes the Android SDK; and Android 4.2 or a later version. The downloaded GetStartedWithData project requires Android 4.2 or a later version. However, the Mobile Services SDK requires only Android 2.2 or a later version.\n\n## Download the GetStartedWithData project\n\n###Get the sample code\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [download-android-sample-code](../../includes/download-android-sample-code.md)]\n\n### Inspect and run the sample code\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-run-sample-code](../../includes/mobile-services-android-run-sample-code.md)]\n\n## Create a new mobile service in the Management Portal\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data](../../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data.md)]\n\n## Add a new table to the mobile service\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data-2](../../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data-2.md)]\n\n## Update the app to use the mobile service for data access\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-data](../../includes/mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-data.md)]\n\n\n## Test the app against your new mobile service\n\nNow that the app has been updated to use Mobile Services for back end storage, you can test it against Mobile Services, using either the Android emulator or an Android phone.\n\n1. From the **Run** menu, click **Run app** to start the project.\n\n    This executes your app, built with the Android SDK, that uses the client library to send a query that returns items from your mobile service.\n\n5. As before, type meaningful text, then click **Add**.\n\n    This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.\n\n3. In the [Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.\n\n4.
