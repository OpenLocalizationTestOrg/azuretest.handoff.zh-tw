Enabling logging in web services provides additional information to help troubleshoot the APIs beyond just and error number and a message.  \n\n-   How to enable logging in Web Services:   \n    -   To enable logging, you need to access the Web Service Dashboard from the Azure Portal, then click to enable it by clicking on the Yes button then clicking on Save.  \n-   What is the effect of enabling logging:  \n    -   When Logging is enabled, all the diagnostics/errors from the default endpoint are logged to the Azure Storage Account linked with the user’s workspace. You can see this storage account in the Azure portal Dashboard view (bottom of the Quick Glance section) of their workspace.  \n-   Where is it available:  \n    -   We enable Logging for the Web Service’s default endpoint currently. We will soon be offering this feature for the additional endpoints that the user can create in the Azure portal.  \n-   How to view the logs:  \n    -   The logs can be viewed using any of the several tools available to ‘explore’ an Azure Storage Account. The easiest may be to simply navigate to the Storage Account in the Azure portal and then click on the CONTAINERS tab. You would then see a Container named **ml-diagnostics**. This container holds all the diagnostics info for all the web service endpoints for all the workspaces associated with this Storage account.  \n-   What are the log blob details:  \n    -   Each blob in the container holds the diagnostics info for exactly one of the following:\n        -   An execution of the Batch-Execution method  \n        -   An execution of the Request-Response method  \n        -   Initialization of a Request-Response container  \n    -   The name of each blob has a prefix of the following form: {Workspace Id}-{Web service Id}-{Endpoint Id}/{Log type}  \n-   Log type takes one of the following values:  \n    batch  \n    score/requests  \n    score/init  \n\n \n\ntest\n"
