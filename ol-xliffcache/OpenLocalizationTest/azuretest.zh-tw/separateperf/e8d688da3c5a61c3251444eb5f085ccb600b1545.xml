When new data is available, a new instance of your Logic App runs with the data as input. To prevent the same data from being consumed multiple times, the trigger may clean-up data that has been read and passed to the Logic App. Examples of such connectors are File, SQL, and Azure Storage.\n2. Push Triggers: These triggers listen for data on an endpoint or for an event to occur. Then, trigger a new instance of a Logic App. Examples of such connectors are HTTP Listener and Twitter.\n\n## Connectors as Actions\nConnectors can also be used as actions within your Logic App. Actions are useful for looking up data within the Logic App that can then used in the execution. For example, you may need to look up data from a SQL database for additional information about a customer when processing an order. Or, you may need to write, update or delete data in a destination. You can do this using the actions provided by the connectors. Actions map to operations in API Apps (as defined by their Swagger metadata).\n\n## Create your own Connectors and API Apps\n[Connectors and API Apps Reference](http://aka.ms/appservicesconnectorreference)  \n[Azure App Service API app triggers](../app-service-api/app-service-api-dotnet-triggers.md)  \n[Logic App Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn948510.aspx)\n\n\n## More on Connectors and API Apps\n\n[What are Connectors and BizTalk API Apps](app-service-logic-what-are-biztalk-api-apps.md)  \n[Using the Hybrid Connection Manager in Azure App Service](app-service-logic-hybrid-connection-manager.md)  \n[Manage and Monitor your built-in API Apps and Connectors](app-service-logic-monitor-your-connectors.md)\n\ntest\n"
