This doesn’t take the place of the VIP (Virtual IP) that is assigned to your cloud service. Rather, it’s an additional IP address that you can use to connect directly to your VM or role instance.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] In the past, an ILPIP was referred to as a PIP, which stands for Public IP. \n\n![Difference between ILPIP and VIP](./media/virtual-networks-instance-level-public-ip/Figure1.png)\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the cloud service is accessed using a VIP, while the individual VMs are normally accessed using VIP:&lt;port number&gt;. By assigning an ILPIP to a specific VM, that VM can be accessed directly using that IP address.\n\nWhen you create a cloud service in Azure, corresponding DNS A records are created automatically to allow access to the service through a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of using the actual VIP. The same process happens for ILPIP, allowing access to the VM or role instance by FQDN instead of the ILPIP. For instance, if you create a cloud service named *contosoadservice*, and you configure a web role named *contosoweb* with two instances, Azure will register the following A records for the instances:\n\n- contosoweb\\_IN_0.contosoadservice.cloudapp.net\n- contosoweb\\_IN_1.contosoadservice.cloudapp.net \n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] You can assign only one ILPIP for each VM or role instance. You can use up to 5 ILPIP's per subscription. At this time, ILPIP is not supported for multi-NIC VMs.\n\n## Why should I request an ILPIP?\nIf you want to be able to connect to your VM or role instance by an IP address assigned directly to it, rather than using the cloud service VIP:&lt;port number&gt;, request an ILPIP for your VM or your role instance.\n- **Passive FTP** - By having an ILPIP on your VM, you can receive traffic on just about any port, you will not have to open up an endpoint to receive traffic. This enables scenarios like passive FTP where the ports are chosen dynamically.\n- **Outbound IP** - Outbound traffic originating from the VM goes out with the ILPIP as the source and this uniquely identifies the VM to external entities.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] The use of reserved ILPIPs may incur an extra cost to your Azure subscription. For more information on ILPIP pricing, see [IP Address pricing](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ip-addresses/).\n\n## How to request an ILPIP during VM creation\nThe PowerShell script below creates a new cloud service named *FTPService*, then retrieves an image from Azure, and creates a VM named *FTPInstance* using the retrieved image, sets the VM to use an ILPIP, and adds the VM to the new service:\n\n    New-AzureService -ServiceName FTPService -Location \"Central US\"\n    $image = Get-AzureVMImage|?{$_.ImageName -like \"*RightImage-Windows-2012R2-x64*\"}\n    New-AzureVMConfig -Name FTPInstance -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $image.ImageName `\n    | Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -Windows -AdminUsername adminuser -Password MyP@ssw0rd!! `\n    | Set-AzurePublicIP -PublicIPName ftpip | New-AzureVM -ServiceName FTPService -Location \"Central US\"\n\n## How to retrieve ILPIP information for a VM\nTo view the ILPIP information for the VM created with the script above, run the following PowerShell command and observe the values for *PublicIPAddress* and *PublicIPName*:\n\n    Get-AzureVM -Name FTPInstance -ServiceName FTPService\n\n    DeploymentName              : FTPService\n    Name                        : FTPInstance\n    Label                       : \n    VM                          : Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Model.PersistentVM\n    InstanceStatus              : ReadyRole\n    IpAddress                   : 100.74.118.91\n    InstanceStateDetails        : \n    PowerState                  : Started\n    InstanceErrorCode           : \n    InstanceFaultDomain         : 0\n    InstanceName                : FTPInstance\n    InstanceUpgradeDomain       : 0\n    InstanceSize                : Small\n    HostName                    : FTPInstance\n    AvailabilitySetName         : \n    DNSName                     : http://ftpservice888.cloudapp.net/\n    Status                      : ReadyRole\n    GuestAgentStatus            : Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Model.GuestAgentStatus\n    ResourceExtensionStatusList : {Microsoft.Compute.BGInfo}\n    PublicIPAddress             : 104.43.142.188\n    PublicIPName                : ftpip\n    NetworkInterfaces           : {}\n    ServiceName                 : FTPService\n    OperationDescription        : Get-AzureVM\n    OperationId                 : 568d88d2be7c98f4bbb875e4d823718e\n    OperationStatus             : OK\n\n## How to remove an ILPIP from a VM\nTo remove the ILPIP added to the VM in the script above, run the following PowerShell command:\n    \n    Get-AzureVM -ServiceName FTPService -Name FTPInstance `\n    | Remove-AzurePublicIP `\n    | Update-AzureVM\n\n## How to add an ILPIP to an existing VM\nTo add an ILPIP to the VM created using the script above, runt he following command:\n\n    Get-AzureVM -ServiceName FTPService -Name FTPInstance `\n    | Set-AzurePublicIP -PublicIPName ftpip2 `\n    | Update-AzureVM\n\n## How to associate an ILPIP to a VM by using a service configuration file\nYou can also associate an ILPIP to a VM by using a service configuration (CSCFG) file.
