You know how to use Docker and have Docker images to store. (You don't? [Learn about Docker](https://www.docker.com))\n2. You have a server that has Docker engine installed. (You don't? [Do it quickly on Azure.](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/docker-simple-on-ubuntu/))\n\n\n## What is a Private Docker Registry?\n\nIn order to ship your containerized applications to the cloud,\nyou construct a Docker container image and store it somewhere so that it can be\nused by yourself and by others. \n\nWhile creating a container image and shipping it to the cloud is easy,\nit is a challenge to store the generated image reliably. For that reason,\nDocker offers a centralized service called [Docker Hub][docker-hub] to store\ncontainer images on the cloud and allows you to create containers\nanytime using those images.\n\nAlthough the [Docker Hub][docker-hub] is a paid service for storing\nyour private application container images, Docker respects developersâ€™ needs and\nprovides an open-source toolset to store your images in your own private Docker\nregistry behind a firewall or on-premises without hitting the public Internet.\nBecause Azure Blob storage is easy to secure, you can quickly use it to create\nand use a private Docker registry in Azure that you control yourself.\n\n## Why should you Host a Docker Registry on Azure?\n\nBy hosting your Docker Registry instance on Microsoft Azure and storing your\nimages on Azure Blob Storage, you can have several benefits:\n\n**Security:** Your Docker images do not leave Azure datacenters, so they do\n  not cross the public Internet as they would if you were using Docker Hub.\n  \n**Performance:** Your Docker images are stored are stored within the same\ndatacenter or region as your applications. This means the images will be\npulled faster and more reliably compared to Docker Hub.\n\n**Reliability:** By using Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, you can make use\nof many storage properties like high availability, redundancy, premium\nstorage (SSDs), and so on.\n\n## Configuring Docker Registry to use Azure Blob Storage\n\n(It's recommended to read the [Docker Registry 2.0 documentation][registry-docs]\nbefore proceeding.)\n\nYou can [configure][registry-config] your Docker Registry in two different ways.\nYou can:\n\n1. Use a `config.yml` file. In this case you will need to create a\n  separate Docker image on top of `registry` image.\n2. Override the default configuration file through environment variables:\n  gets things done without creating and maintaining a separate Docker image.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, this topic follows option 2, using\nthe environment variables.\n\nIn order to run a Docker Registry instance which:\n* uses your Azure Storage Account for storing the images\n* listens on the Virtual Machine's port 5000\n* has no authentication configured (not recommended, see the note below)\n\nyou need to run the following Docker command in your bash\nterminal (replace `<storage-account>` and `<storage-key>` \nwith your credentials):\n\n```sh\n$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \\\n     -e REGISTRY_STORAGE=azure \\\n     -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNTNAME=\"<storage-account>\" \\\n     -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNTKEY=\"<storage-key>\" \\\n     -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_CONTAINER=\"registry\" \\\n     --name=registry \\\n     registry:2\n```\n\nOnce the command exits, you can see the container hosting\nyour private Docker Registry instance by running the `docker ps`\ncommand on your host:\n\n```sh\n$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES\n3698ddfebc6f        registry:2          \"registry cmd/regist   2 seconds ago       Up 1 seconds        0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   registry\n```\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Configuring security for the Docker Registry\nis not covered in this document and your registry will be accessible\nto anyone without authentication by default if you open up the port to\nthe registry port on the Virtual Machine endpoint or load balancer if you\nuse the deployment command above.\n>\n> Please read the [Configuring Docker\nRegistry][registry-config] documentation to learn how to secure the\nregistry instance and your images.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce you have your registry set up, it's time to go use it some more.
