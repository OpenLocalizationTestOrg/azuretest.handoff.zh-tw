The farm contains these computers:\n\n- Two SharePoint web servers\n- Two SharePoint application servers\n- Two database servers\n- One cluster majority node server\n- Two domain controllers\n\nThis is the configuration, with placeholder names for each server:\n\n![](./media/virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-overview/workload-spsqlao_05.png)\n\nTwo machines for each role ensure high availability. All of the virtual machines are in a single region. Each group of virtual machines for a specific role is in its own availability set.\n\nYou deploy this configuration in the following phases:\n\n- [Phase 1: Configure Azure](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase1.md). Create a storage account, cloud services, and a cross-premises virtual network.\n- [Phase 2: Configure domain controllers](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase2.md). Create and configure replica Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controllers.\n- [Phase 3: Configure SQL Server infrastructure](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase3.md). Create and configure the SQL Server virtual machines, prepare them for use with SharePoint, and create the cluster.\n- [Phase 4: Configure SharePoint servers](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase4.md). Create and configure the four SharePoint virtual machines.\n- [Phase 5: Create the availability group and add the SharePoint databases](virtual-machines-workload-intranet-sharepoint-phase5.md). Prepare databases and create a SQL Server AlwaysOn availability group.\n\nThis deployment of SharePoint with SQL Server AlwaysOn is designed to accompany the [SharePoint with SQL Server AlwaysOn infographic](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394788) and incorporate the latest recommendations.\n\nThis configuration is a prescriptive, phase-by-phase guide for a predefined architecture to create a functional, highly available intranet SharePoint farm in Azure infrastructure services. For additional architectural guidance on implementing SharePoint 2013 in Azure, see [Microsoft Azure architectures for SharePoint 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn635309.aspx).\n\nKeep the following in mind:\n\n- If you are an experienced SharePoint implementer, please feel free to adapt the instructions in phases 3 through 5 and build the farm that best suits your needs.\n- If you already have an existing Azure hybrid cloud implementation, feel free to adapt or skip the instructions in phases 1 and 2 to host the new SharePoint farm on the appropriate subnet.\n- All of the servers are located on a single subnet in the Azure virtual network.
