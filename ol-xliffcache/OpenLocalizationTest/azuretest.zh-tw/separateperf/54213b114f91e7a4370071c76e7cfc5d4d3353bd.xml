Customers who use tapes to address their long-term-retention needs now have a powerful and viable alternative with the availability of this feature. The feature is enabled in the latest release of the Azure Backup (which is available [here](http://aka.ms/azurebackup_agent)).

For example, the settings in the screen below indicate that backups will be taken daily at 6pm and at midnight.\n\n![Daily Schedule](./media/backup-azure-backup-cloud-as-tape/dailybackupschedule.png)\n\nCustomers can also schedule a weekly backup.
