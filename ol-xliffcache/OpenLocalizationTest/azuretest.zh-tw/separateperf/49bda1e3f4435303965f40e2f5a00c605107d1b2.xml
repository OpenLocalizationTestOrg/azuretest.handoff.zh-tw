This can save you a lot of time when you need a basic or high-availability SharePoint farm for a development and testing environment or if you are evaluating SharePoint Server 2013 as a collaboration solution for your organization.\n\nThe basic SharePoint farm consists of three virtual machines in this configuration.\n\n![sharepointfarm](./media/virtual-machines-sharepoint-farm-azure-preview/SPFarm_Basic.png)\n\nYou can use this farm configuration for a simplified setup for SharePoint app development or your first-time evaluation of SharePoint 2013.\n\nThe high-availability SharePoint farm consists of nine virtual machines in this configuration.\n\n![sharepointfarm](./media/virtual-machines-sharepoint-farm-azure-preview/SPFarm_HighAvail.png)\n\nYou can use this farm configuration to test higher client loads, high availability of the external SharePoint site, and SQL Server AlwaysOn for a SharePoint farm. You can also use this configuration for SharePoint app development in a high-availability environment.\n\nFor the configuration details for both of these farms, see [SharePoint Server Farm Configuration Details](virtual-machines-sharepoint-farm-config-azure-preview.md).\n\n## Stepping through configuration\n\nTo create your SharePoint farm with the SharePoint Server Farm template, do the following:\n\n1. In the [Microsoft Azure Preview Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click  **New** > **Compute** > **SharePoint Server Farm**. If **SharePoint Server Farm** does not appear, click **New** > **Compute** > **Marketplace**, type **SharePoint** in **Search Compute**, and then click **SharePoint Server Farm**. In the **SharePoint Server Farm** pane, click **Create**.\n2. In the **Create a SharePoint farm** pane, type the name of a resource group.\n3. Type a user name and password for a local administrator account on each virtual machine in your farm. Choose a name and password that is difficult to guess, record it, and store it in a secure location.\n4. If you want the high-availability farm, click **Enable high availability**.\n5. To configure your domain controllers, click the arrow. You can specify a host name prefix (the default is the resource group name), forest root domain name (default is contoso.com), and the size of your domain controllers (default is A1).\n6. To configure your SQL servers, click the arrow. You can specify a host name prefix (the default is the resource group name), the size of your SQL servers (default is A5), a database access account name and password (the default is to use the administrator account), and a SQL server service account name (the default is sqlservice) and password (the default is to use the same password as the administrator account).\n7. To configure your SharePoint servers, click the arrow. You can specify a host name prefix (the default is the resource group name), the size of your SharePoint servers (default is A2), a SharePoint user account (the default is sp_setup) and password, a SharePoint farm account name (the default is sp_farm) and password, and a SharePoint farm passphrase. The default is to use the administrator password for the SharePoint user account, farm account, and passphrase.\n8. To configure optional configuration settings for the virtual network, storage account, or diagnostics, click the corresponding arrow.\n9. To specify the subscription, click the arrow.\n10. When you are done, click **Create**.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The domain controller does not have the Active Directory Management tools installed by default.
