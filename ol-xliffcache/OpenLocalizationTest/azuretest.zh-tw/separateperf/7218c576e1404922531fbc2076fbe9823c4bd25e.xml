With the feedback you get about the performance and effectiveness of your app in the wild, you can make informed choices about the direction of the design in each development lifecycle.\n\n![Example](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/sample.png)\n\nYou'll need a subscription with [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.com). Sign in with a Microsoft account, which you might have for Windows, XBox Live, or other Microsoft cloud services. \n\n\n#### Sample Application instrumented with Application Insights\n\nTake a look at this [sample application](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService) in which Application Insights is added to a cloud service with two worker roles hosted in Azure. \n\nWhat follows tells you how to adapt your own cloud service project in the same way.\n\n## Create an Application Insights resource for each role\n\nAn Application Insights resource is where your telemetry data will be analyzed and displayed.  \n\n1.  In the [Azure portal][portal], create a new Application Insights resource. For application type, choose ASP.NET app. \n\n    ![Click New, Application Insights](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/01-new.png)\n\n2.  Take a copy of the Instrumentation Key. You'll need this shortly to configure the SDK.\n\n    ![Click Properties, select the key, and press ctrl+C](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/02-props.png)\n\n\nIt's usually best to create a separate resource for the data from each web and worker role. \n\nAs an alternative, you could send data from all the roles to just one resource, but set a [default property][apidefaults] so that you can filter or group the results from each role.\n\n## <a name=\"sdk\"></a>Install the SDK in each project\n\n\n1. In Visual Studio, edit the NuGet packages of your cloud app project.\n\n    ![Right-click the project and select Manage Nuget Packages](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/03-nuget.png)\n\n2. Add the [Application Insights for Web] (http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web) NuGet package. This version of the SDK includes modules that add server context such as role information.\n\n    ![Search for \"Application Insights\"](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/04-ai-nuget.png)\n\n\n3. Configure the SDK to send data to the Application Insights resource.\n\n    Open `ApplicationInsights.config` and insert this line:\n\n    `<InstrumentationKey>` *the instrumentation key you copied* `</InstrumentationKey>`\n\n    Use the instrumentation key you copied from the Application Insights resource.\n\n4. Set the ApplicationInsights.config file to be copied always to the output directory. This is only required for worker roles.\n\n\nYou can alternatively set the instrumentation key (iKey) in code. This is useful, for example, if you want to use Azure Service Configuration (CSCFG) settings to manage the instrumentation keys for the respective environments.\nThe [sample application](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService) shows how you can set the iKey:\n\n* [Web role](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/MvcWebRole/Global.asax.cs#L27)\n* [Worker role](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA/WorkerRoleA.cs#L232)\n* [For web pages](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/MvcWebRole/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml#L13)\n\n## Use the SDK to report telemetry\n### Report Requests\n * In web roles, the requests module automatically collects data about HTTP requests. See the [sample MVCWebRole](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/MvcWebRole) for examples of how you can override the default collection behavior. \n * You can capture the performance of calls to worker roles by tracking them in the same way as HTTP requests. In Application Insights, the Request telemetry type measures a unit of named server side work that can be timed and can independently succeed or fail. While HTTP requests are captured automatically by the SDK, you can insert your own code to track requests to worker roles.\n * See the two sample worker roles instrumented to report requests: [WorkerRoleA](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA) and [WorkerRoleB](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleB)\n\n### Report Dependencies\n  * Application Insights SDK can report calls that your app makes to external dependencies such as REST apis and SQL servers. This lets you see whether a particular dependency is causing slow responses or failures.\n  * To track dependencies, you have to set up the web/worker role with the [Application Insights Agent](app-insights-monitor-performance-live-website-now.md) also known as \"Status Monitor\".\n  * To use the Application Insights Agent with your web/worker roles:\n    * Add the [AppInsightsAgent](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA/AppInsightsAgent) folder and the two files in it to your web/worker role projects. Be sure to set their build properties so that they are always copied into the output directory. These files install the agent.\n    * Add the start up task to the CSDEF file as shown [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/AzureEmailService/ServiceDefinition.csdef#L18).\n    * NOTE: *Worker roles* require three environment variables as shown [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/AzureEmailService/ServiceDefinition.csdef#L44). This is not required for web roles.\n\nHere's an example of what you see at the Application Insights portal:\n\n* Rich diagnostics with automatically correlated requests and dependencies:\n\n    ![](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/SMxacy4.png)\n\n* Performance of the web role, with dependency information:\n\n    ![](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/6yOBtKu.png)\n\n* Here's a screenshot on the requests and dependency information for a worker role:\n\n    ![](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/a5R0PBk.png)\n\n### Reporting Exceptions\n\n* See [Monitoring Exceptions in Application Insights](app-insights-asp-net-exceptions.md) for information on how you can collect unhandled exceptions from different web application types.\n* The sample web role has MVC5 and Web API 2 controllers. The unhandled exceptions from the 2 are captured with the following:\n    * [AiHandleErrorAttribute](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/MvcWebRole/Telemetry/AiHandleErrorAttribute.cs) set up [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/MvcWebRole/App_Start/FilterConfig.cs#L12) for MVC5 controllers\n    * [AiWebApiExceptionLogger](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/MvcWebRole/Telemetry/AiWebApiExceptionLogger.cs) set up [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/MvcWebRole/App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs#L25) for Web API 2 controllers\n* For worker roles: There are two ways to track exceptions.\n    * TrackException(ex)\n    * If you have added the Application Insights trace listener NuGet package, you can use System.Diagnostics.Trace to log exceptions. [Code example.](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA/WorkerRoleA.cs#L107)\n\n### Performance Counters\n\nThe following counters are collected by default:\n\n    * \\Process(??APP_WIN32_PROC??)\\% Processor Time\n    * \\Memory\\Available Bytes\n    * \\.NET CLR Exceptions(??APP_CLR_PROC??)\\# of Exceps Thrown / sec\n    * \\Process(??APP_WIN32_PROC??)\\Private Bytes\n    * \\Process(??APP_WIN32_PROC??)\\IO Data Bytes/sec\n    * \\Processor(_Total)\\% Processor Time\n\nIn addition, the following are also collected for web roles:\n\n    * \\ASP.NET Applications(??APP_W3SVC_PROC??)\\Requests/Sec    \n    * \\ASP.NET Applications(??APP_W3SVC_PROC??)\\Request Execution Time\n    * \\ASP.NET Applications(??APP_W3SVC_PROC??)\\Requests In Application Queue\n\nYou can specify additional custom or other windows performance counters as shown [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA/ApplicationInsights.config#L14)\n\n  ![](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/OLfMo2f.png)\n\n### Correlated Telemetry for Worker Roles\n\nIt is a rich diagnostic experience, when you can see what led to a failed or high latency request. With web roles, the SDK automatically sets up correlation between related telemetry. \nFor worker roles, you can use a custom telemetry initializer to set a common Operation.Id context attribute for all the telemetry to achieve this. \nThis will allow you to see whether the latency/failure issue was caused due to a dependency or your code, at a glance! \n\nHere's how:\n\n* Set the correlation Id into a CallContext as shown [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA/WorkerRoleA.cs#L36). In this case, we are using the Request ID as the correlation id\n* Add a custom TelemetryInitializer implementation, that will set the Operation.Id to the correlationId set above. Shown here: [ItemCorrelationTelemetryInitializer](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA/Telemetry/ItemCorrelationTelemetryInitializer.cs#L13)\n* Add the custom telemetry initializer. You could do that in the ApplicationInsights.config file, or in code as shown [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/WorkerRoleA/WorkerRoleA.cs#L233)\n\nThat's it! The portal experience is already wired up to help you see all associated telemetry at a glance:\n\n![](./media/app-insights-cloudservices/bHxuUhd.png)\n\n#### No data?\n\n* Open the [Search][diagnostic] tile, to see individual events.\n* Use the application, opening different pages so that it generates some telemetry.\n* Wait a few seconds and click Refresh.\n* See [Troubleshooting][qna].\n\n\n## Complete your installation\n\nTo get the full 360-degree view of your application, there are some more things you should do:\n\n\n* [Add the JavaScript SDK to your web pages][client] to get browser-based telemetry such as page view counts, page load times, script exceptions, and to let you write custom telemetry in your page scripts.\n* Add dependency tracking to diagnose issues caused by databases or other components used by your app:\n * [in your Azure Web App or VM][azure]\n * [in your on-premises IIS server][redfield]\n* [Capture log traces][netlogs] from your favorite logging framework\n* [Track custom events and metrics][api] in client or server or both, to learn more about how your application is used.\n* [Set up web tests][availability] to make sure your application stays live and responsive.\n\n\n\n## Example\n\n[The example](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService) monitors a service that has a web role and two worker roles.\n\n\n\n[api]: app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md\n[apidefaults]: app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md#default-properties\n[apidynamicikey]: app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md#dynamic-ikey\n[availability]: app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability.md\n[azure]: app-insights-azure.md\n[client]: app-insights-javascript.md\n[diagnostic]: app-insights-diagnostic-search.md\n[netlogs]: app-insights-asp-net-trace-logs.md\n[perf]: app-insights-web-monitor-performance.md\n[portal]: http://portal.azure.com/\n[qna]: app-insights-troubleshoot-faq.md\n[redfield]: app-insights-monitor-performance-live-website-now.md\n[start]: app-insights-get-started.md \ntest\n"
