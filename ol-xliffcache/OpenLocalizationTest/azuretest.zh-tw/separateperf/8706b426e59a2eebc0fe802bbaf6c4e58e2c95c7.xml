We'll show you how to access and create blob containers, and how to perform common tasks like uploading, listing, and downloading blobs. The samples are written in C\\# and use the [Azure Storage Client Library for .NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn261237.aspx).\n\nAzure Blob Storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. A single blob can be any size. Blobs can be things like images, audio and video files, raw data, and document files.\n\nJust as files live in folders, storage blobs live in containers. After you have created a storage, you create one or more containers in the storage. For example, in a storage called “Scrapbook,” you can create containers in the storage called “images” to store pictures and another called “audio” to store audio files. After you create the containers, you can upload individual blob files to them.\n\n- For more information on programmatically manipulating blobs, see [How to use blob storage from .NET](storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs.md).\n- For general information about Azure Storage,see [Storage documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/storage/).\n- For general information about Azure Cloud Services, see [Cloud Services documentation](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/cloud-services/).\n- For more information about programming ASP.NET applications, see [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net).\n\n## Access blob containers in code\n\nTo programmatically access blobs in cloud service projects, you need to add the following items, if they're not already present.\n\n1. Add the following code namespace declarations to the top of any C# file in which you wish to programmatically access Azure Storage.\n\n        using Microsoft.Framework.Configuration;\n        using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;\n        using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;\n        using System.Threading.Tasks;\n        using LogLevel = Microsoft.Framework.Logging.LogLevel;\n\n2. Get a `CloudStorageAccount` object that represents your storage account information. Use the following code to get the your storage connection string and storage account information from the Azure service configuration.\n\n        CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(\n        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting(\"<storage account name>_AzureStorageConnectionString\"));\n\n3. Get a `CloudBlobClient` object to reference an existing container in your storage account.\n\n        // Create a blob client.\n        CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();\n\n4. Get a `CloudBlobContainer` object to reference a specific blob container.\n\n        // Get a reference to a container named “mycontainer.”\n        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference(\"mycontainer\");\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] Use all of the code shown in the previous procedure in front of the code shown in the following sections.\n\n## Create a container in code\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] Some APIs that perform calls out to Azure Storage in ASP.NET are asynchronous. See [Asynchronous programming with Async and Await](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh191443.aspx) for more information. The code in the following example assumes that you are using async programming methods.\n\nTo create a container in your storage account, all you need to do is add a call to `CreateIfNotExistsAsync` as in the following code:\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudBlobContainer with the variable name 'container'\n    // as described in the \"Access blob containers in code\" section.\n\n    // If “mycontainer” doesn’t exist, create it.\n    await container.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();\n\n\nTo make the files within the container available to everyone, you can set the container to be public by using the following code.\n\n    await container.SetPermissionsAsync(new BlobContainerPermissions\n    {\n        PublicAccess = BlobContainerPublicAccessType.Blob\n    });\n\n\nAnyone on the Internet can see blobs in a public container, but you can\nmodify or delete them only if you have the appropriate access key.\n\n## Upload a blob into a container\n\nAzure Storage supports block blobs and page blobs. In the majority of cases, block blob is the recommended type to use.\n\nTo upload a file to a block blob, get a container reference and use it to get a block blob reference. Once you have a blob reference, you can upload any stream of data to it by calling the `UploadFromStream` method. This operation creates the blob if it didn't previously exist, or overwrites it if it does exist. The following example shows how to upload a blob into a container and assumes that the container was already created.\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudBlobContainer with the variable name 'container' as described in\n    // the \"Access blob containers in code\" section.\n\n    // Retrieve a reference to a blob named \"myblob\".\n    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(\"myblob\");\n\n    // Create or overwrite the \"myblob\" blob with contents from a local file.\n    using (var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(@\"path\\myfile\"))\n    {\n        blockBlob.UploadFromStream(fileStream);\n    }\n\n## List the blobs in a container\n\nTo list the blobs in a container, first get a container reference. You can then use the container's `ListBlobs` method to retrieve the blobs and/or directories within it. To access the rich set of properties and methods for a  returned `IListBlobItem`, you must cast it to a `CloudBlockBlob`, `CloudPageBlob`, or `CloudBlobDirectory` object. If the type is unknown, you can use a type check to determine which to cast it to. The following code demonstrates how to retrieve and output the URI of each item in the `photos` container:\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudBlobContainer with the variable name 'container' as described in\n    // the \"Access blob containers in code\" section.\n    // Loop over items within the container and output the length and URI.\n    foreach (IListBlobItem item in container.ListBlobs(null, false))\n    {\n        if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudBlockBlob))\n        {\n            CloudBlockBlob blob = (CloudBlockBlob)item;\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Block blob of length {0}: {1}\", blob.Properties.Length, blob.Uri);\n\n        }\n        else if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudPageBlob))\n        {\n            CloudPageBlob pageBlob = (CloudPageBlob)item;\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Page blob of length {0}: {1}\", pageBlob.Properties.Length, pageBlob.Uri);\n\n        }\n        else if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudBlobDirectory))\n        {\n            CloudBlobDirectory directory = (CloudBlobDirectory)item;\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Directory: {0}\", directory.Uri);\n        }\n    }\n\nAs shown in the previous code sample, the blob service has the concept of directories within containers, as well. This is so that you can organize your blobs in a more folder-like structure. For example, consider the following set of block blobs in a container named `photos`:\n\n    photo1.jpg\n    2010/architecture/description.txt\n    2010/architecture/photo3.jpg\n    2010/architecture/photo4.jpg\n    2011/architecture/photo5.jpg\n    2011/architecture/photo6.jpg\n    2011/architecture/description.txt\n    2011/photo7.jpg\n\nWhen you call `ListBlobs` on the container (as in the previous sample), the collection returned\ncontains `CloudBlobDirectory` and `CloudBlockBlob` objects representing the directories and blobs contained at the top level. Here is the resulting output:\n\n    Directory: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/\n    Directory: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/\n    Block blob of length 505623: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/photo1.jpg\n\n\nOptionally, you can set the `UseFlatBlobListing` parameter of of the `ListBlobs` method to\n`true`. This results in every blob being returned as a `CloudBlockBlob`, regardless of directory. Here is the call to `ListBlobs`:\n\n    // Loop over items within the container and output the length and URI.\n    foreach (IListBlobItem item in container.ListBlobs(null, true))\n    {\n       ...\n    }\n\nand here are the results:\n\n    Block blob of length 4: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/description.txt\n    Block blob of length 314618: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/photo3.jpg\n    Block blob of length 522713: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/photo4.jpg\n    Block blob of length 4: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/description.txt\n    Block blob of length 419048: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/photo5.jpg\n    Block blob of length 506388: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/photo6.jpg\n    Block blob of length 399751: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/photo7.jpg\n    Block blob of length 505623: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/photo1.jpg\n\nFor more information, see [CloudBlobContainer.ListBlobs][].\n\n## Download blobs\n\nTo download blobs, first retrieve a blob reference and then call the `DownloadToStream` method. The following\nexample uses the `DownloadToStream` method to transfer the blob\ncontents to a stream object that you can then persist to a local file.\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudBlobContainer with the variable name 'container' as described in\n    // the \"Access blob containers in code\" section.\n\n    // Get a reference to a blob named \"photo1.jpg\".\n    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(\"photo1.jpg\");\n\n    // Save blob contents to a file.\n    using (var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenWrite(@\"path\\myfile\"))\n    {\n        blockBlob.DownloadToStream(fileStream);\n    }\n\nYou can also use the `DownloadToStream` method to download the contents of a blob as a text string.\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudBlobContainer with the variable name 'container' as described in\n    // the \"Access blob containers in code\" section.\n\n    // Get a reference to a blob named \"myblob.txt\"\n    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob2 = container.GetBlockBlobReference(\"myblob.txt\");\n\n    string text;\n    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())\n    {\n        blockBlob2.DownloadToStream(memoryStream);\n        text = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(memoryStream.ToArray());\n    }\n\n## Delete blobs\n\nTo delete a blob, first get a blob reference and then call the\n`Delete` method.\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudBlobContainer with the variable name 'container' as described in\n    // the \"Access blob containers in code\" section.\n\n    // Get a reference to a blob named \"myblob.txt\".\n    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(\"myblob.txt\");\n\n    // Delete the blob.\n    blockBlob.Delete();\n\n\n## List blobs in pages asynchronously\n\nIf you are listing a large number of blobs, or you want to control the number of results you return in one listing operation, you can list blobs in pages of results. This example shows how to return results in pages asynchronously, so that execution is not blocked while waiting to return a large set of results.\n\nThis example shows a flat blob listing, but you can also perform a hierarchical listing, by setting the `useFlatBlobListing` parameter of the `ListBlobsSegmentedAsync` method to `false`.\n\nBecause the sample method calls an asynchronous method, it must be prefaced with the `async` keyword, and it must return a `Task` object. The await keyword specified for the `ListBlobsSegmentedAsync` method suspends execution of the sample method until the listing task completes.\n\n    async public static Task ListBlobsSegmentedInFlatListing(CloudBlobContainer container)\n    {\n        // List blobs to the console window, with paging.\n        Console.WriteLine(\"List blobs in pages:\");\n\n        int i = 0;\n        BlobContinuationToken continuationToken = null;\n        BlobResultSegment resultSegment = null;\n\n        // Call ListBlobsSegmentedAsync and enumerate the result segment returned, while the continuation token is non-null.\n        // When the continuation token is null, the last page has been returned and execution can exit the loop.\n        do\n        {\n            // This overload allows control of the page size. You can return all remaining results by passing null for the maxResults parameter,\n            // or by calling a different overload.\n            resultSegment = await container.ListBlobsSegmentedAsync(\"\", true, BlobListingDetails.All, 10, continuationToken, null, null);\n            if (resultSegment.Results.Count<IListBlobItem>() > 0) { Console.WriteLine(\"Page {0}:\", ++i); }\n            foreach (var blobItem in resultSegment.Results)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"\\t{0}\", blobItem.StorageUri.PrimaryUri);\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine();\n\n            //Get the continuation token.\n            continuationToken = resultSegment.ContinuationToken;\n        }\n        while (continuationToken != null);\n    }\n\n## Next steps\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [vs-storage-dotnet-blobs-next-steps](../../includes/vs-storage-dotnet-blobs-next-steps.md)]\n"
