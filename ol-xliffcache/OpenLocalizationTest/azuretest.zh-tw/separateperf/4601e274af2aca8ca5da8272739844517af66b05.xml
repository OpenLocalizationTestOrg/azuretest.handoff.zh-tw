Mobile Services uses a SQL Database to store data. However, binary large object (BLOB) data is more efficiently stored in Azure Blob storage service. \n\nYou cannot securely distribute with the client app the credentials required to securely upload data to the Blob Storage service. Instead, you must store these credentials your mobile service and use them to generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) that is used to upload a new image. The SAS, a credential with a short expiration&mdash;in this case 5 minutes, is returned securely by Mobile Services to the client app. The app then uses this temporary credential to upload the image. In this example, downloads from the Blob service are public.\n\nIn this tutorial, you add functionality to the [GetStartedWithData sample app project](mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-phone-get-started-data.md) to take pictures and upload the images to Azure by using an SAS generated by Mobile Services.\n\n##Prerequisites\n\nThis tutorial requires the following:\n\n+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, or a later version\n+ [Windows Phone SDK 8.0] or higher\n+ Nuget Package Manager installed for Microsoft Visual Studio.\n+ [Azure Storage account][How To Create a Storage Account]\n+ Complete the tutorial [Add Mobile Services to an existing app](mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-phone-get-started-data.md)  \n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]This tutorial only support Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight apps.
