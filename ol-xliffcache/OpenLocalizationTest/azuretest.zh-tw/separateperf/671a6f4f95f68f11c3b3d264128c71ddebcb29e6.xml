You can use the [Azure Docker VM extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docker-extension/blob/master/README.md) to the [Azure Linux Agent](virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide.md) to create a Docker VM that hosts any number of containers for your applications on Azure.\n\nThis topic describes:\n\n+ [Docker and Linux Containers]\n+ [How to use the Docker VM Extension with Azure]\n+ [Virtual Machine Extensions for Linux and Windows]\n\nTo create Docker-enabled VMs right now, see:\n\n+ [How to use the Docker VM Extension from the Azure Command-line Interface (Azure CLI)]\n+ [How to use the Docker VM Extension with the Azure Portal]\n+ [How to Get Started Quickly with Docker in the Azure Marketplace]\n\nTo learn more about the extension and how it works, see the [Docker Extension User Guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docker-extension/blob/master/README.md).\n\n## Docker and Linux Containers\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is one of the most popular virtualization approaches that uses [Linux containers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC) rather than virtual machines as a way of isolating data and computing on shared resources and provides other services that enable you to build or assemble applications quickly and distribute them between other Docker containers.\n\nDocker and Linux containers are not [Hypervisors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor) such as Windows Hyper-V and [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) on Linux (there are many other examples). Hypervisors virtualize the underlying operating system to enable complete operating systems (called *virtual machines*) to run inside the hypervisor as if they were an application.\n\nDocker and other *container* approaches have radically decreased both the start-up time consumed and processing and storage overhead required by using the process and file system isolation features of the Linux kernel to expose only kernel features to an otherwise isolated container.\n\nThe following table describes at a very high level the kind of feature differences that exist between hypervisors and Linux containers.

To secure your container system more strongly than the default configuration, [Docker recommends](https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/) using addition group-policy or [role-based security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) as well, such as [SELinux](http://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) or [AppArmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page), for example, as well as reducing as much as possible the kernel capabilities that the containers are granted. In addition, there are many other documents on the Internet that describe approaches to security using containers like Docker.\n\n## How to use the Docker VM Extension with Azure\n\nThe Docker VM Extension is a component that is installed in the VM instance that you create which itself installs the Docker engine and manages remote communication with the VM. There are two ways to install the VM Extension: You can create your VM using the management portal or you can create it from the Azure Command-line Interface (Azure CLI).\n\nYou can use the portal to add the Docker VM Extension to any compatible Linux VM (currently, the only image that supports it is the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS image more recent than July).
