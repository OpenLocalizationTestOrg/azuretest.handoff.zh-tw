Users can run commands with elevated privileges by using the `sudo` command. However, the experience may vary depending on how the system was provisioned.\n\n1. **SSH key and password OR password only** - the virtual machine was provisioned with either a certificate (`.CER` file) or SSH key as well as a password, or just a user name and password. In this case `sudo` will prompt for the user's password before executing the command.\n\n2. **SSH key only** - the virtual machine was provisioned with a certificate (`.cer` or `.pem` file) or SSH key, but no password.  In this case `sudo` **will not** prompt for the user's password before executing the command.\n\n\n## SSH Key and Password, or Password Only\n\nLog into the Linux virtual machine using SSH key or password authentication, then run commands using `sudo`, for example:\n\n    # sudo <command>\n    [sudo] password for azureuser:\n\nIn this case the user will be prompted for a password. After entering the password `sudo` will run the command with `root` privileges.\n\nYou can also enable passwordless sudo by editing the `/etc/sudoers.d/waagent` file, for example:\n\n    #/etc/sudoers.d/waagent\n    azureuser ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nThis change will allow for passwordless sudo by the user \"azureuser\".\n\n## SSH Key Only\n\nLog into the Linux virtual machine using SSH key authentication, then run commands using `sudo`, for example:\n\n    # sudo <command>\n\nIn this case the user will **not** be prompted for a password. After pressing `<enter>`, `sudo` will run the command with `root` privileges.\n\n \n"
