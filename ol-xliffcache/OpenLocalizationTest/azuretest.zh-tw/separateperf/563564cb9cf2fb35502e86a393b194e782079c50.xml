The “Glossary” in “Concepts” has the definitions of terms and abbreviations in Analytics and Monitoring, such as the following: Active User, New user, Retained User, Session, User Path Graph, Users Map, Tracking URLs, Trends, Activity, Event, Job, Error, Extra Info, Crash, and App-info.\n\n### See also\n-  [Concepts - Glossary][Link 6], [Troubleshooting Guide - Analytics][Link 21]\n\n## Monitor - Sessions, Jobs, Events, Errors, and Crashes\nYou can see how many users are currently in session and on specific screens or doing specific actions. You can view user activity divided by Sessions, Jobs, Events, Errors, and Crashes. You can see the current information and show the information from the last hour, day, or week. You can see all of the information in each category or sort by the specific Session, Job, Event, Error, and Crash.  Live monitoring is helpful to use during events such as a Push campaign to see if there is an uptick in action right after you send your Push notification. \n \n![Monitor1][14]  \n\n## Troubleshooting with Monitor - Events - Details\nGenerating an event in your application from your test device and finding it in Monitor - Events - Details is one of the easiest ways to find your Device ID for your test device and to confirm that Azure Mobile Engagement integration of Analytics, Monitoring, and Segments is working from your application. Once you have the Device ID of your test device, you can add it to your test devices in “My Account - Devices”. If you can't generate an event, make sure that Azure Mobile Engagement is correctly integrated in your Android/iOS/Web/Windows/Windows Phone app with the SDK.\n\n### See also\n-  [SDK Documentation][Link 5]\n\n![Monitor2][15]  \n\n## Troubleshooting with Monitor - Crashes - Details\nYou can review crash information about your app from Monitor - Crashes - Details to help determine why your app is crashing.
