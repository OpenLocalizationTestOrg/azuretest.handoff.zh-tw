This means that you need to make some choices about the virtual machine and how to create it. This article gives you a summary of these choices and links to instructions.\n\nAzure Resource Manager templates were recently introduced as a way to create and manage a virtual machine and its different resources as one logical deployment unit. Instructions for this approach are included below, where available. To learn more about Azure Resource Manager and how to manage resources as one unit, see the [Overview][].\n\n## Tool choices\n\n### GUI: The Azure portal or Azure preview portal\n\nThe graphical user interface of the Azure portal is an easy way to try out a virtual machine, especially if you're just starting out with Azure. Use either the Azure portal or the Azure preview portal to create the virtual machine:\n\n[Create a virtual machine running Windows][]\n\n### Command shell: Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell\n\nIf you prefer working in a command shell, choose between the Azure command-line interface (CLI) for Mac and Linux users, or Azure PowerShell, which has Windows PowerShell cmdlets for Azure and a custom console.\n\nFor Azure CLI, see [Equivalent Resource Manager and Service Management commands for virtual machine operations with the Azure CLI for Mac, Linux, and Windows][].

Azure and its partners offer many images, some of which include applications and tools. Or, use one of your own images.\n\n### Azure images\n\nThese instructions show you how to use an Azure image to create a virtual machine that's customized with options for networking, load balancing, and more.
