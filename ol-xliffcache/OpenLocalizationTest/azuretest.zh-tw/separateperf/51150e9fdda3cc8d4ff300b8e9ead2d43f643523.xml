Monitor the status of updates. Type:\n\n    `Get-HcsUpdateStatus`\n    \n    If the `RunInProgress` is `True`, the update is still in progress. If `RunInProgress` is `False`, it indicates that the update has completed.  \n\n7. When the update is installed on the current controller and it has restarted, connect to the other controller and perform steps 1 through 6.\n\n8. After both controllers are updated, exit Maintenance mode. See [Step 4: Exit Maintenance mode](storsimple-update-device.md#step4) for instructions.\n"
