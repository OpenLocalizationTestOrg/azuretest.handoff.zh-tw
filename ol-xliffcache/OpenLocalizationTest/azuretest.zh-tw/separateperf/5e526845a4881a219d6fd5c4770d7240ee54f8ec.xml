The Azure CLI provides a set of open source shell-based commands for managing resources on Microsoft Azure.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] If you've already installed the Azure CLI, connect it with your Azure resources. For more, see [How to connect to your Azure Subscription](xplat-cli-connect.md#configure).\n\nThe Azure CLI is written in JavaScript, and requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). It is implemented using the [Azure SDK for Node](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-node), and released under an Apache 2.0 license. The project repository is located at [https://github.com/azure/azure-xplat-cli](https://github.com/azure/azure-xplat-cli).\n\n<a id=\"install\"></a>\n## How to install the Azure CLI\n\nThere are few ways to install the Azure CLI.\n\n1. Using an installer\n2. Installing Node.js and npm and then using the **npm install** command\n3. Run Azure CLI as a Docker container\n\nOnce the Azure CLI has been installed, you will be able to use the **azure** command from your command-line interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt) to access the Azure CLI commands.\n\n## Using an installer\n\nThe following installer packages are available:\n\n* [Windows installer][windows-installer]\n\n* [OS X installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252249)\n\n* [Linux installer][linux-installer]\n\n\n## Installing and using Node.js and npm\n\nIf Node.js is already installed on your system, use the following command to install the Azure CLI:\n\n    npm install azure-cli -g\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] On Linux distributions, you may need to use `sudo` to successfully run the __npm__ command.\n\n### Installing node.js and npm on Linux distributions that use [dpkg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg) package management\nThe most common of these distributions use either the [advanced packaging tool (apt)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) or other tools based on the `.deb` package format. Some examples are Ubuntu and Debian.\n\nMost of the more recent of these distributions require installing **nodejs-legacy** in order to get a properly configured **npm** tool to install the Azure CLI. The following code shows the commands that install **npm** properly on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n    sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy\n    sudo apt-get install npm\n    sudo npm install -g azure-cli\n\nSome of the older distributions, such as Ubuntu 12.04, require installing the current binary distribution of node.js. The following code shows how to do that by installing and using **curl**.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] The commands here are taken from the Joyent installation instructions found [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager). However, when using **sudo** as a pipe target, you should always check the scripts that you are installing and validate that they do exactly what you expect before running them through **sudo**. With great power comes great responsibility.\n\n    sudo apt-get install curl\n    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -\n    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n    sudo npm install -g azure-cli\n\n### Installing node.js and npm on Linux distributions that use [rpm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) package management\n\nInstalling node.js on RPM-based distributions requires enabling the EPEL repository. The following code shows the best practices for installation on CentOS 7. (Note that in the first line below, the '-' (hyphen) is important!)\n\n    su -\n    yum update [enter]\n    yum upgrade –y [enter]\n    yum install epel-release [enter]\n    yum install nodejs [enter]\n    yum install npm [enter]\n    npm install -g azure-cli  [enter]\n\n### Installing node.js and npm on Windows and Mac OS X\n\nYou can install node.js and npm on Windows and OS X using the installers from [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/download/). You might need to restart the computer to complete the installation. Check if node and npm was installed properly by opening command prompt and typing\n\n    npm -v\n\nIf it shows the version of the npm installed, you can go ahead and install Azure CLI with\n\n    npm install -g azure-cli\n\nOnce the Azure CLI has been installed, you will be able to use the **azure** command from your command-line user interface to access the Azure CLI commands. At the end of the installation, you should see something similar to the following:\n\n    azure-cli@0.8.0 ..\\node_modules\\azure-cli\n    |-- easy-table@0.0.1\n    |-- eyes@0.1.8\n    |-- xmlbuilder@0.4.2\n    |-- colors@0.6.1\n    |-- node-uuid@1.2.0\n    |-- async@0.2.7\n    |-- underscore@1.4.4\n    |-- tunnel@0.0.2\n    |-- omelette@0.1.0\n    |-- github@0.1.6\n    |-- commander@1.0.4 (keypress@0.1.0)\n    |-- xml2js@0.1.14 (sax@0.5.4)\n    |-- streamline@0.4.5\n    |-- winston@0.6.2 (cycle@1.0.2, stack-trace@0.0.7, async@0.1.22, pkginfo@0.2.3, request@2.9.203)\n    |-- kuduscript@0.1.2 (commander@1.1.1, streamline@0.4.11)\n    |-- azure@0.7.13 (dateformat@1.0.2-1.2.3, envconf@0.0.4, mpns@2.0.1, mime@1.2.10, validator@1.4.0, xml2js@0.2.8, wns@0.5.3, request@2.25.0)\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] For Linux systems, you can also install the Azure CLI by building it from the [source](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=253472&clcid=0x409). For more information on building from source, see the INSTALL file included in the archive.\n\n## Using Docker Container\n\nIn a Docker host, run:\n```\n    docker run -it microsoft/azure-cli\n```\n\n## Executing Azure CLI Commands\n\nOnce the Azure CLI has been installed, you will be able to use the **azure** command from your command-line user interface (Bash, Terminal, cmd.exe, and so on) to access the Azure CLI commands.  For example to execute the help command in Windows launch a Command Prompt (cmd.exe) with Administrator privileges:\n```\n    c:\\> azure help\n```\n\nNow you are ready! Next you can [connect to your Azure subscription from the Azure CLI](xplat-cli-connect.md) and start using the **azure** commands.\n\n\n<a id=\"additional-resources\"></a>\n## Additional resources\n\n* [Using the Azure CLI with the Service Management (or ASM mode) commands][cliasm]\n\n* [Using the Azure CLI with the Resource Management (or ARM mode) commands][cliarm]\n\n* For more information on Azure CLI, download source code, report problems, or contribute to the project, visit the [GitHub repository for the Azure CLI](https://github.com/azure/azure-xplat-cli).\n\n* If you encounter problems using the Azure CLI, or Azure, visit the [Azure Forums](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsazure/home).\n\n* For more information on Azure, see [http://azure.microsoft.com/](http://azure.microsoft.com).\n\n\n\n\n[mac-installer]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252249\n[windows-installer]: http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9828653&clcid=0x409\n[linux-installer]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=253472\n[cliasm]: virtual-machines/virtual-machines-command-line-tools.md\n[cliarm]: virtual-machines/xplat-cli-azure-resource-manager.md\n\ntest\n"
