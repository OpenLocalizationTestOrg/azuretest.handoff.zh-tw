Privileged actions include elevation changes (for example, role creation or password resets), changing policy configurations (for example password policies), or changes to directory configuration (for example, changes to domain federation settings). The reports provide the audit record for the event name, the actor who performed the action, the target resource affected by the change, and the date and time (in UTC). Customers are able to retrieve the list of audit events for their Azure Active Directory via the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), as described in [View your access and usage reports](active-directory-view-access-usage-reports.md).\n\n## Audit report retention\n\nEvents in the Azure AD Audit report are retained for 180 days. For more information about retention on reports, see [Azure Active Directory Report Retention Policies](active-directory-reporting-retention.md).\n\nFor customers interested in storing their audit events for longer retention periods, the Reporting API can be used to regularly pull audit events into a separate data store. See [Getting Started with the Reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started.md) for details.\n\n## Properties included with each audit event\n\n| Property  | Description                               |\n| ------    | ------                                |\n| Date and Time | The date and time that the audit event occured            |\n| Actor     | The user or service principal that performed the action       |\n| Action    | The action that was performed                     |\n| Target    | The user or service principal that the action was performed on    |\n\n## List of Audit Report Events\n\n<!--- audit event descriptions should be in the past tense --->\n\n| Events                | Event Description                                                                             |\n| ------------------------------    | -------                                                                                   |\n| Add User              | Added a user to the directory.                                                                        |\n| Delete User               | Deleted a user from the directory.                                                                        |\n| Set license properties        | Set the license properties for a user in the directory.                                                           |\n| Reset user password           | Reset the password for a user in the directory.                                                               |\n| Change user password          | Changed the password for a user in the directory.                                                             |\n| Change user license           | Changed the license assigned to a user in the directory.                                                          |\n| Update user               | Updated a user in the directory.                                                                      |\n| Add role member to Role       | Added a user to a directory role.                                                                     |\n| Remove role member from Role      | Removed a user from a directory role.                                                                 |\n| Set Company contact information   | Set company-level contact preferences.
