Using Azure Automation, manual, frequently-repeated, long-running, and error-prone tasks can be automated to increase reliability, efficiency, and time to value for your organization.\n\nAzure Automation provides a highly-reliable, highly-available workflow execution engine that scales to meet your needs.
