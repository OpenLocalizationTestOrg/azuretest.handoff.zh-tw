For more information, see [Build universal Windows apps that target Windows and Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn609832.aspx).\n\nIn this tutorial, you will download a Visual Studio 2013 project for a universal Windows app that stores data in memory, create a new mobile service, integrate the mobile service with the app, and then sign-in to the Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]This topic shows you how to use the tooling in Visual Studio Professional 2013 with Update 3 to connect a new mobile service to a universal Windows app. The same steps can be used to connect a mobile service to a Windows Store or Windows Phone Store 8.1 app. To connect a mobile service to an Windows Phone 8.0 or Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1 app, see [Get started with data for Windows Phone](mobile-services-windows-phone-get-started-data.md).\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need the following:\n\n* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-universal-dotnet-get-started-data%2F).\n* [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546) (Update 2 or a later version). \n\n##<a name=\"download-app\"></a>Download the GetStartedWithData project\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-universal-dotnet-download-project](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-universal-dotnet-download-project.md)]\n \n\n##<a name=\"create-service\"></a>Create a new mobile service from Visual Studio\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-vs2013](../../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-vs2013.md)]\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;7. In Solution Explorer, open the App.xaml.cs code file in the GetStartedWithData.Shared project folder, and notice the new static field that was added to the **App** class inside a Windows Store app conditional compilation block, which looks like the following example: \n\n    public static Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices.MobileServiceClient \n        todolistClient = new Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices.MobileServiceClient(\n            \"https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/\",\n            \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\");\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;This code provides access to your new mobile service in your app by using an instance of the [MobileServiceClient] class. The client is created by supplying the URI and the application key of the new mobile service. This static field is available to all pages in your app.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Right-click the Windows Phone app project, click **Add**, click **Connected Service...**, select the mobile service that you just created, and then click **OK**. The same code is added to the shared App.xaml.cs file, but this time within a Windows Phone app conditional compilation block.\n\nAt this point, both the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store apps are connected to the new mobile service. The next step is to create a new TodoItem table in the mobile service.\n\n##<a name=\"add-table\"></a>Add a new table to the mobile service\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-table-vs2013](../../includes/mobile-services-create-new-table-vs2013.md)]\n\n##<a name=\"update-app\"></a>Update the app to use the mobile service\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-dotnet-update-data-app](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-dotnet-update-data-app.md)]\n\n##<a name=\"test-azure-hosted\"></a>Test the mobile service hosted in Azure\n\nNow we can test both versions of the universal Windows app against the mobile service hosted in Azure.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-universal-test-app](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-universal-test-app.md)]\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
