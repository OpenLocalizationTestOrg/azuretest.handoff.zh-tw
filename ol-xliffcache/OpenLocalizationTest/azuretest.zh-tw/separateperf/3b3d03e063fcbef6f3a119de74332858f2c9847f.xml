If a 401 is encountered, a new login request to obtain a new token will be setup on the UI thread. Other calls will be blocked until the login is completed, or until 5 attempts have failed. If the new token is obtained, the request that triggered the 401 will be retried with the new token and any blocked calls will be retried with the new token. \n\n7. In the ToDoActivity.java file, add this code for a new `ProgressFilter` class inside the ToDoActivity class:\n        \n        /**\n        * The ProgressFilter class renders a progress bar on the screen during the time the App is waiting for the response of a previous request.\n        * the filter shows the progress bar on the beginning of the request, and hides it when the response arrived.\n        */\n        private class ProgressFilter implements ServiceFilter {\n            @Override\n            public ListenableFuture<ServiceFilterResponse> handleRequest(ServiceFilterRequest request, NextServiceFilterCallback nextServiceFilterCallback) {\n\n                final SettableFuture<ServiceFilterResponse> resultFuture = SettableFuture.create();\n\n                runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n\n                    @Override\n                    public void run() {\n                        if (mProgressBar != null) mProgressBar.setVisibility(ProgressBar.VISIBLE);\n                    }\n                });\n\n                ListenableFuture<ServiceFilterResponse> future = nextServiceFilterCallback.onNext(request);\n\n                Futures.addCallback(future, new FutureCallback<ServiceFilterResponse>() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onFailure(Throwable e) {\n                        resultFuture.setException(e);\n                    }\n\n                    @Override\n                    public void onSuccess(ServiceFilterResponse response) {\n                        runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n\n                            @Override\n                            public void run() {\n                                if (mProgressBar != null) mProgressBar.setVisibility(ProgressBar.GONE);\n                            }\n                        });\n\n                        resultFuture.set(response);\n                    }\n                });\n\n                return resultFuture;\n            }\n        }\n        \n    This filter will show the progress bar on the beginning of the request and will hide it when the response arrived.\n\n8. In the ToDoActivity.java file, update the `onCreate` method as follows:\n\n        @Override\n        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n            \n            setContentView(R.layout.activity_to_do);\n            mProgressBar = (ProgressBar) findViewById(R.id.loadingProgressBar);\n        \n            // Initialize the progress bar\n            mProgressBar.setVisibility(ProgressBar.GONE);\n        \n            try {\n                // Create the Mobile Service Client instance, using the provided\n                // Mobile Service URL and key\n                mClient = new MobileServiceClient(\n                        \"https://<YOUR MOBILE SERVICE>.azure-mobile.net/\",\n                        \"<YOUR MOBILE SERVICE KEY>\", this)\n                           .withFilter(new ProgressFilter())\n                           .withFilter(new RefreshTokenCacheFilter());\n            \n                // Authenticate passing false to load the current token cache if available.\n                authenticate(false);\n                    \n            } catch (MalformedURLException e) {\n                createAndShowDialog(new Exception(\"Error creating the Mobile Service. \" +\n                    \"Verify the URL\"), \"Error\");\n            }\n        }\n\n\n       In this code, `RefreshTokenCacheFilter` is used in addition to `ProgressFilter`. Also during `onCreate` we want to load the token cache. So `false` is passed in to the `authenticate` method.\n\n\n"
