After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.  \n\nThis tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:\n\n1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]\n2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]\n3. [Add authentication to the app]\n4.

You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]This tutorial demonstrates the authentication flow managed by Mobile Services using a variety of identity providers. This method is easy to configure and supports multiple providers. To instead use Live Connect with client-managed authentication and provide a single sign-on experience in your Windows Phone app, see the topic [Single sign-on for Windows Store apps by using Live Connect]. By using client-managed authentication, your app has access to additional user data maintained by the identity provider. You can get the same user data in your mobile service by by calling the **user.getIdentities()** function in server scripts.
