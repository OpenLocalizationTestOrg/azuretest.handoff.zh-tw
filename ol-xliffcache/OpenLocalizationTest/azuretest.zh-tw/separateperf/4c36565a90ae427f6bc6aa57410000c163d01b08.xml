Unlike the previous [Add push notifications to your app] tutorial, this tutorial changes your mobile service to require that a user be authenticated before the client can register with the notification hub for push notifications. Registration is also modified to add a tag based on the assigned user ID. Finally, the server script is updated to send the notification only to the authenticated user instead of to all registrations.\n \n>[AZURE.NOTE]This tutorial supports Windows Phone 8.0 and Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight apps.
