Or, if you like to update your configuration files directly, download a service configuration file to update, and then upload the updated file and update the cloud service with the configuration changes. Either way, the configuration updates are pushed out to all role instances.\n\nThe Azure Management Portal also allows you to [enable Remote Desktop Connection for a Role in Azure Cloud Services](cloud-services-role-enable-remote-desktop.md)\n\nAzure can only ensure 99.95 percent service availability during the configuration updates if you have at least two role instances for every role. That enables one virtual machine to process client requests while the other is being updated. For more information, see [Service Level Agreements](http://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/).\n\n## Change a cloud service\n\n1. In the [Azure Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/), click **Cloud Services**, click the name of the cloud service, and then click **Configure**.\n\n    ![Configuration Page](./media/cloud-services-how-to-configure/CloudServices_ConfigurePage1.png)\n    \n    On the **Configure** page, you can configure monitoring, update role settings, and choose the guest operating system and family for role instances. \n\n2. In **monitoring**, set the monitoring level to Verbose or Minimal, and configure the diagnostics connection strings that are required for verbose monitoring.\n\n3. For service roles (grouped by role), you can update the following settings:\n    \n    >**Settings**  \n    >Modify the values of miscellaneous configuration settings that are specified in the *ConfigurationSettings* elements of the service configuration (.cscfg) file.\n    >\n    >**Certificates**  \n    >Change the certificate thumbprint that's being used in SSL encryption for a role. To change a certificate, you must first upload the new certificate (on the **Certificates** page). Then update the thumbprint in the certificate string displayed in the role settings.\n\n4. In **operating system**, you can change the operating system family or version for role instances, or choose **Automatic** to enable automatic updates of the current operating system version.

To save your configuration settings, and push them to the role instances, click **Save**. (Click **Discard** to cancel the changes.) **Save** and **Discard** are added to the command bar after you change a setting.\n\n## Update a cloud service configuration file\n\n1. Download a cloud service configuration file (.cscfg) with the current configuration. On the **Configure** page for the cloud service, click **Download**. Then click **Save**, or click **Save As** to save the file.\n\n2. After you update the service configuration file, upload and apply the configuration updates:\n\n    1. On the **Configure** page, click **Upload**.\n    \n        ![Upload Configuration](./media/cloud-services-how-to-configure/CloudServices_UploadConfigFile.png)\n    \n    2.
