Visual Studio can deploy the application to the local cluster and automatically connect the debugger to all instances of your application.\n\n1. Start a local development cluster by following the steps in [setting up your Service Fabric development environment](service-fabric-get-started.md).\n\n2. Press **F5** or click **Debug** > **Start Debugging**\n\n    ![Start debugging an application][startdebugging]\n\n3. Set breakpoints in your code and step through the application by clicking on commands in the **Debug** menu.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] Visual Studio attaches to all instances of your application. While stepping through code, breakpoints may get hit by multiple processes resulting in concurrent sessions. Try disabling the breakpoint(s) after being hit, making the breakpoint conditional on the thread ID, or using Diagnostic Events.\n\n4. The **Diagnostic Events** window will automatically open to view diagnostic events in real time.\n\n    ![View diagnostic events in real time][diagnosticevents]\n\n5. You can also open the **Diagnostic Events** window in the Server Explorer.  Under **Azure**, right click on **Service Fabric Cluster** > **View Diagnostic Events...**\n\n    ![Open the diagnostic events window][viewdiagnosticevents]\n\n6. The diagnostic events can be seen in the automatically generated **ServiceEventSource.cs** and are called from application code.\n\n    ```csharp\n    ServiceEventSource.Current.ServiceTypeRegistered(Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id, Service.ServiceTypeName);\n    ```\n\n7. The **Diagnostic Events** window supports filtering, pausing, and inspecting events in real time.  The filter is a simple string search of the event message, including its contents.\n\n    ![Filter, pause and resume, or inspect events in real time][diagnosticeventsactions]\n\n8. Debugging services is similar to debugging any other application. Breakpoints can be set normally through Visual Studio for easy debugging. Even though Reliable Collections are replicated across multiple nodes, they still implement IEnumerable, which means you can use the Results View in Visual Studio while debugging to see what you've stored inside. Simply set a break point anywhere in your code.\n\n    ![Start debugging an application][breakpoint]\n\n<!--Every topic should have next steps and links to the next logical set of content to keep the customer engaged-->\n## Next steps\n\n- [Test a Service Fabric service](service-fabric-test-your-service-index.md).\n- [Managing your Service Fabric applications in Visual Studio](service-fabric-manage-application-in-visual-studio.md).\n\n<!--Image references-->\n[startdebugging]: ./media/service-fabric-debugging-your-application/startdebugging.png\n[diagnosticevents]: ./media/service-fabric-debugging-your-application/diagnosticevents.png\n[viewdiagnosticevents]: ./media/service-fabric-debugging-your-application/viewdiagnosticevents.png\n[diagnosticeventsactions]: ./media/service-fabric-debugging-your-application/diagnosticeventsactions.png\n[breakpoint]: ./media/service-fabric-debugging-your-application/breakpoint.png\n \n"
