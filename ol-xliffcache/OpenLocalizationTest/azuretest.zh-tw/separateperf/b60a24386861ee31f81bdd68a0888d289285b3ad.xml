It makes associating a custom domain name AND securing communication (SSL) with Azure Cloud Services or [App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529714) a snap.\n\nYou can secure the communication between the web app and the browser with HTTPS, which uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. This is the most commonly used method of securing data sent across the internet, and assures visitors that their transactions with your App are secure. This article discusses how to configure HTTPS for a web app in Azure App Service. This article does not cover client certificate authentication; for information about that, see [How To Configure TLS Mutual Authentication for Web Apps](../articles/app-service-web/app-service-web-configure-tls-mutual-auth.md).\n\n##<a name=\"bkmk_azurewebsites\"></a>HTTPS for the \\*.azurewebsites.net domain\n\nIf you are not planning on using a custom domain name, but are instead planning on using the \\*.azurewebsites.net domain assigned to your web app by Azure (for example, contoso.azurewebsites.net) then HTTPS is already enabled on your site with a certificate from Microsoft. You can use **https://mywebsite.azurewebsites.net** to access your App. However, \\*.azurewebsites.net is a wildcard domain. Like [all wildcard domains](https://casecurity.org/2014/02/26/pros-and-cons-of-single-domain-multi-domain-and-wildcard-certificates/), it is not as secure as using a custom domain with your own certificate. \n\nThe rest of this document provides details on enabling HTTPS for custom domains, such as **contoso.com**, **www.contoso.com**, or **\\*.contoso.com**\n\n##<a name=\"bkmk_domainname\"></a>Enable SSL for your custom domain\n\nTo enable HTTPS for a custom domain, such as **contoso.com**, you must first register a custom domain name with a domain name registrar. For more information on how to configure the domain name of a web app, see [Configuring a custom domain name for an Azure Web Site](/en-us/develop/net/common-tasks/custom-dns-web-site/). Once you have registered a custom domain name and configured your web app to respond to the custom name, you must request an SSL certificate for the domain. \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] In order to enable HTTPS for custom domain names, you must configure your web app for **Standard** mode. This may incur additional costs if you are currently using free or shared mode. For more information on shared and **Standard** pricing, see [Pricing Details][pricing]. \n\n##<a name=\"bkmk_getcert\"></a>Get an SSL certificate\n\nBefore requesting an SSL certificate you must first determine which domain names will be secured by the certificate. This will determine what type of certificate you must obtain. If you just need to secure a single domain name such as **contoso.com** or **www.contoso.com** a basic certificate is sufficient. If you need to secure multiple domain names, such as **contoso.com**, **www.contoso.com**, and **mail.contoso.com**, then you can get a [wildcard certificate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_certificate), or a certificate with [Subject Alternate Name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubjectAltName) (subjectAltName).\n\nSSL certificates used with Web Apps must be signed by a [Certificate Authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) (CA). If you do not already have one, you will need to obtain one from a company that issues SSL certificates. For a list of Certificate Authorities, see [Windows and Windows Phone 8 SSL Root Certificate Program (Members CAs)][cas] on the Microsoft TechNet Wiki.\n\nThe certificate must meet the following requirements for SSL certificates in Azure:\n\n* The certificate must contain a private key.\n* The certificate must be created for key exchange, exportable to a Personal Information Exchange (.pfx) file.\n* The certificate's subject name must match the domain used to access the web app. If you need to serve multiple domains with this certificate, you will need to use a wildcard value or specify subjectAltName values as discussed previously.\n* The certificate should use a minimum of 2048-bit encryption.\n* Certificates issued from private CA servers are not supported by Azure App Service.\n\nTo get an SSL certificate for use with Azure App Service, you submit a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to a Certificate Authority and then generate a .pfx file from the certificate you receive back. You can do this using the tool of your choice. Below are some of the common ways to get a certificate:\n\n- [Get a certificate using Certreq.exe](#bkmk_certreq)\n- [Get a certificate using IIS Manager](#bkmk_iismgr)\n- [Get a certificate using OpenSSL](#bkmk_openssl)\n- [Get a SubjectAltName certificate using OpenSSL](#bkmk_subjectaltname)\n- [Generate self-signed certificates (for testing only)](#bkmk_selfsigned) \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] When following the steps, you will be prompted to enter a **Common Name**, such as `www.contoso.com`. For wildcard certificates, this value should be \\*.domainname (for example, \\*.contoso.com). If you need to support both a wildcard name like \\*.contoso.com and a root domain name like contoso.com, you can use a wildcard subjectAltName certificate.\n>\n> Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates are supported with Azure App Service; however, they are relatively new and you should work with your CA on the exact steps to create the CSR.\n\nYou may also need to obtain **[intermediate certificates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_certificate_authorities)** (also known as chain certificates), if these are used by your CA. The use of intermediate certificates is considered more secure than 'unchained certificates', so it is common for a CA to use them. Intermediate certificates are often provided as a separate download from the CAs website. The steps in this article provide steps to ensure that any intermediate certificates are merged with the certificate uploaded to your web apps. \n\n<a name=\"bkmk_certreq\"></a>\n###Get a certificate using Certreq.exe (Windows only)\n\nCertreq.exe is Windows utility for creating certificate requests. It has been part of the base Windows installation since Windows XP/Windows Server 2000, so should be available on recent Windows systems. Use the following steps to obtain an SSL certificate using certreq.exe.\n\n1. Open **Notepad** and create a new document that contains the following. Replace **mysite.com** on the Subject line with the custom domain name of your web app. For example, Subject = \"CN=www.contoso.com\".\n\n        [NewRequest]\n        Subject = \"CN=mysite.com\"\n        Exportable = TRUE\n        KeyLength = 2048\n        KeySpec = 1\n        KeyUsage = 0xA0\n        MachineKeySet = True\n        ProviderName = \"Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider\"\n        ProviderType = 12\n        RequestType = CMC\n\n        [EnhancedKeyUsageExtension]\n        OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1\n\n    For more information on the options specified above, as well as other available options, see the [Certreq reference documentationn](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc725793.aspx).\n\n2. Save the text file as **myrequest.txt**.\n\n3. From the **Start Screen** or **Start Menu**, run **cmd.exe**.\n\n4. From the command prompt, use the following command to create the certificate request file:\n\n        certreq -new \\path\\to\\myrequest.txt \\path\\to\\create\\myrequest.csr\n\n    Specify the path to the **myrequest.txt** file created in step 1, and the path to use when creating the **myrequest.csr** file.\n\n5. Submit the **myrequest.csr** to a Certificate Authority to obtain an SSL certificate. This may involve uploading the file, or opening the file in Notepad and pasting the contents directly into a web form.\n\n    For a list of Certificate Authorities, see [Windows and Windows Phone 8 SSL Root Certificate Program (Members CAs)][cas] on the Microsoft TechNet Wiki.\n\n6. Once the Certificate Authority has provided you with a certificate (.CER) file, save this file to the computer used to generate the request, and then use the following command to accept the request and complete the certificate generation process.\n\n        certreq -accept -user mycert.cer\n\n    In this case, the **mycert.cer** certificate received from the Certificate Authority will be used to complete the signature of the certificate. No file will be created; instead, the certificate will be stored in the Windows certificate store.\n\n6. If your CA uses intermediate certificates, you must install these certificates before exporting the certificate in the next steps. Usually these certificates are provided as a separate download from your CA, and are provided in several formats for different web server types. Select the version that is provided for Microsoft IIS.\n\n    Once you have downloaded the certificate, right click on it in explorer and select **Install certificate**. Use the default values in the **Certificate Import Wizard**, and continue selecting **Next** until the import has completed.\n\n7. To export the certificate from the certificate store, run **certmgr.msc** from the **Start Screen** or **Start Menu**. When **Certificate Manager** appears, expand the **Personal** folder, and then select **Certificates**. In the **Issued To** field, look for an entry with the custom domain name you requested a certificate for. In the **Issued By** field, it should list the Certificate Authority you used for this certificate.\n\n    ![insert image of cert manager here][certmgr]\n\n9. Right click the certificate and select **All Tasks**, and then select **Export**. In the **Certificate Export Wizard**, click **Next** and then select **Yes, export the private key**. Click **Next**.\n\n    ![Export the private key][certwiz1]\n\n10. Select **Personal Information Exchange - PKCS #12**, **Include all certificates in the certificate chain**, and **Export all extended properties**. Click **Next**.\n\n    ![include all certs and extended properties][certwiz2]\n\n11. Select **Password**, and then enter and confirm the password. Click **Next**.\n\n    ![specify a password][certwiz3]\n\n12. Provide a path and filename that will contain the exported certificate. The filename should have an extension of **.pfx**. Click **Next** to complete the process.\n\n    ![provide a file path][certwiz4]\n\nYou can now upload the exported PFX file to your Azure web app.\n\n<a name=\"bkmk_openssl\"></a>\n###Get a certificate using OpenSSL\n\n1. Generate a private key and Certificate Signing Request by using the following from a command-line, bash or terminal session:\n\n        openssl req -new -nodes -keyout myserver.key -out server.csr -newkey rsa:2048\n\n2. When prompted, enter the appropriate information. For example:\n\n        Country Name (2 letter code) \n        State or Province Name (full name) []: Washington\n        Locality Name (eg, city) []: Redmond\n        Organization Name (eg, company) []: Microsoft\n        Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: Azure\n        Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []: www.microsoft.com\n        Email Address []:\n\n        Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request\n\n        A challenge password []: \n\n    Once this process completes, you should have two files; **myserver.key** and **server.csr**. The **server.csr** contains the Certificate Signing Request.\n\n3. Submit your CSR to a Certificate Authority to obtain an SSL certificate. For a list of Certificate Authorities, see [Windows and Windows Phone 8 SSL Root Certificate Program (Members CAs)][cas] on the Microsoft TechNet Wiki.\n\n4. Once you have obtained a certificate from a CA, save it to a file named **myserver.crt**. If your CA provided the certificate in a text format, simply paste the certificate text into the **myserver.crt** file. The file contents should be similar to the following when viewed in a text editor:\n\n        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n        MIIDJDCCAgwCCQCpCY4o1LBQuzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFADBUMQswCQYDVQQGEwJV\n        UzELMAkGA1UECBMCV0ExEDAOBgNVBAcTB1JlZG1vbmQxEDAOBgNVBAsTB0NvbnRv\n        c28xFDASBgNVBAMTC2NvbnRvc28uY29tMB4XDTE0MDExNjE1MzIyM1oXDTE1MDEx\n        NjE1MzIyM1owVDELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMxCzAJBgNVBAgTAldBMRAwDgYDVQQHEwdS\n        ZWRtb25kMRAwDgYDVQQLEwdDb250b3NvMRQwEgYDVQQDEwtjb250b3NvLmNvbTCC\n        ASIwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADggEPADCCAQoCggEBAN96hBX5EDgULtWkCRK7DMM3\n        enae1LT9fXqGlbA7ScFvFivGvOLEqEPD//eLGsf15OYHFOQHK1hwgyfXa9sEDPMT\n        3AsF3iWyF7FiEoR/qV6LdKjeQicJ2cXjGwf3G5vPoIaYifI5r0lhgOUqBxzaBDZ4\n        xMgCh2yv7NavI17BHlWyQo90gS2X5glYGRhzY/fGp10BeUEgIs3Se0kQfBQOFUYb\n        ktA6802lod5K0OxlQy4Oc8kfxTDf8AF2SPQ6BL7xxWrNl/Q2DuEEemjuMnLNxmeA\n        Ik2+6Z6+WdvJoRxqHhleoL8ftOpWR20ToiZXCPo+fcmLod4ejsG5qjBlztVY4qsC\n        AwEAATANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFAAOCAQEAVcM9AeeNFv2li69qBZLGDuK0NDHD3zhK\n        Y0nDkqucgjE2QKUuvVSPodz8qwHnKoPwnSrTn8CRjW1gFq5qWEO50dGWgyLR8Wy1\n        F69DYsEzodG+shv/G+vHJZg9QzutsJTB/Q8OoUCSnQS1PSPZP7RbvDV9b7Gx+gtg\n        7kQ55j3A5vOrpI8N9CwdPuimtu6X8Ylw9ejWZsnyy0FMeOPpK3WTkDMxwwGxkU3Y\n        lCRTzkv6vnHrlYQxyBLOSafCB1RWinN/slcWSLHADB6R+HeMiVKkFpooT+ghtii1\n        A9PdUQIhK9bdaFicXPBYZ6AgNVuGtfwyuS5V6ucm7RE6+qf+QjXNFg==\n        -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\n    Save the file.\n\n5.

Generate a CSR with IIS Manager to send to the Certificate Authority. For more information on generating a CSR, see [Request an Internet Server Certificate (IIS 7)][iiscsr].\n\n2. Submit your CSR to a Certificate Authority to obtain an SSL certificate. For a list of Certificate Authorities, see [Windows and Windows Phone 8 SSL Root Certificate Program (Members CAs)][cas] on the Microsoft TechNet Wiki.\n\n3. Complete the CSR with the certificate provided by the Certificate Authority vendor.

The exported file will be used in later steps to upload to Azure for use with your web app.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] During the export process, be sure to select the option <strong>Yes, export the private key</strong>. This will include the private key in the exported certificate.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] During the export process, be sure to select the option **include all certs in the certification path** and **Export all extended properties**. This will include any intermediate certificates in the exported certificate.\n\n\n###<a name=\"bkmk_subjectaltname\"></a>Get a SubjectAltName certificate using OpenSSL\n\nOpenSSL can be used to create a certificate request that uses the SubjectAltName extension to support multiple domain names with a single certificate, however it requires a configuration file. The following steps walk through creating a configuration file, and then using it to request a certificate.\n\n1. Create a new file named __sancert.cnf__ and use the following as the contents of the file:\n \n        # -------------- BEGIN custom sancert.cnf -----\n        HOME = .\n        oid_section = new_oids\n        [ new_oids ]\n        [ req ]\n        default_days = 730\n        distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name\n        encrypt_key = no\n        string_mask = nombstr\n        req_extensions = v3_req # Extensions to add to certificate request\n        [ req_distinguished_name ]\n        countryName = Country Name (2 letter code)\n        countryName_default = \n        stateOrProvinceName = State or Province Name (full name)\n        stateOrProvinceName_default = \n        localityName = Locality Name (eg, city)\n        localityName_default = \n        organizationalUnitName  = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)\n        organizationalUnitName_default  = \n        commonName              = Your common name (eg, domain name)\n        commonName_default      = www.mydomain.com\n        commonName_max = 64\n        [ v3_req ]\n        subjectAltName=DNS:ftp.mydomain.com,DNS:blog.mydomain.com,DNS:*.mydomain.com\n        # -------------- END custom sancert.cnf -----\n\n    Note the line that begins with 'subjectAltName'. Replace the domain names currently listed with domain names you wish to support in addition to the common name. For example:\n\n        subjectAltName=DNS:sales.contoso.com,DNS:support.contoso.com,DNS:fabrikam.com\n\n    You do not need to change the commonName_default field, as you will be prompted to enter your common name in one of the following steps.\n\n2. Save the __sancert.cnf__ file.\n\n1. Generate a private key and Certificate Signing Request by using the sancert.cnf configuration file. From a bash or terminal session, use the following command:\n\n        openssl req -new -nodes -keyout myserver.key -out server.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -config sancert.cnf\n\n2. When prompted, enter the appropriate information. For example:\n\n        Country Name (2 letter code) []: US\n        State or Province Name (full name) []: Washington\n        Locality Name (eg, city) []: Redmond\n        Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: Azure\n        Your common name (eg, domain name) []: www.microsoft.com\n \n\n    Once this process completes, you should have two files; **myserver.key** and **server.csr**. The **server.csr** contains the Certificate Signing Request.\n\n3. Submit your CSR to a Certificate Authority to obtain an SSL certificate. For a list of Certificate Authorities, see [Windows and Windows Phone 8 SSL Root Certificate Program (Members CAs)][cas] on the Microsoft TechNet Wiki.\n\n4.

From the Developer Command Prompt, use the following command to create a new self-signed certificate. You must substitute **serverdnsname** with the DNS of your web app.\n\n        makecert -r -pe -b 01/01/2013 -e 01/01/2014 -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 -ss My -n CN=serverdnsname -sky exchange -sp \"Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider\" -sy 12 -len 2048\n\n    This command will create a certificate that is good between the dates of 01/01/2013 and 01/01/2014, and will store the location in the CurrentUser certificate store.\n\n3. From the **Start Menu** or **Start Screen**, search for **Windows PowerShell** and start this application.\n\n4. From the Windows PowerShell prompt, use the following commands to export the certificate created previously:\n\n        $mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \"password\" -Force -AsPlainText\n        get-childitem cert:\\currentuser\\my -dnsname serverdnsname | export-pfxcertificate -filepath file-to-export-to.pfx -password $mypwd\n\n    This stores the specified password as a secure string in $mypwd, then finds the certificate by using the DNS name specified by the **dnsname** parameter, and exports to the file specified by the **filepath** parameter. The secure string containing the password is used to secure the exported file.\n\n<a name=\"bkmk_ssopenssl\"></a>\n####Generate a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL ####\n\n1. Create a new document named **serverauth.cnf**, using the following as the contents of this file:\n\n        [ req ]\n        default_bits           = 2048\n        default_keyfile        = privkey.pem\n        distinguished_name     = req_distinguished_name\n        attributes             = req_attributes\n        x509_extensions        = v3_ca\n\n        [ req_distinguished_name ]\n        countryName         = Country Name (2 letter code)\n        countryName_min         = 2\n        countryName_max         = 2\n        stateOrProvinceName     = State or Province Name (full name)\n        localityName            = Locality Name (eg, city)\n        0.organizationName      = Organization Name (eg, company)\n        organizationalUnitName      = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)\n        commonName          = Common Name (eg, your app's domain name)\n        commonName_max          = 64\n        emailAddress            = Email Address\n        emailAddress_max        = 40\n\n        [ req_attributes ]\n        challengePassword       = A challenge password\n        challengePassword_min       = 4\n        challengePassword_max       = 20\n\n        [ v3_ca ]\n         subjectKeyIdentifier=hash\n         authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always,issuer:always\n         basicConstraints = CA:false\n         keyUsage=nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\n         extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth\n\n    This specifies the configuration settings required to produce an SSL certificate that can be used by Azure App Service.\n\n2. Generate a new self-signed certificate by using the following from a command-line, bash or terminal session:\n\n        openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myserver.key -out myserver.crt -config serverauth.cnf\n\n    This creates a new certificate using the configuration settings specified in the **serverauth.cnf** file.\n\n3. To export the certificate to a .PFX file that can be uploaded to a web app, use the following command:\n\n        openssl pkcs12 -export -out myserver.pfx -inkey myserver.key -in myserver.crt\n\n    When prompted, enter a password to secure the .pfx file.\n\n    The **myserver.pfx** produced by this command can be used to secure your web app for testing purposes.\n\n<a name=\"bkmk_standardmode\"></a><h2>Configure Standard mode</h2>\n\nEnabling HTTPS for a custom domain is only available for the **Standard** mode of web app. Use the following steps to switch to **Standard** mode.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] Before switching a web app from the **Free** mode to **Standard** mode, you should remove spending caps in place for your web app subscription, otherwise you risk your site becoming unavailable if you reach your caps before the billing period ends.

In your browser, open the [Azure Management Portal](https://portal.azure.com).\n2.  Click the **Browse** option on the left side of the page.\n3.  Click the **Web Apps** blade.\n4.  Click the name of your web app.\n5.  In the **Essentials** page, click **Settings**. \n6.  Click **Custom domains and SSL**.\n    ![The config tab][sslconfig]\n7.  In the **certificates** section, click **Upload**\n8.  Using the **Upload a certificate** dialog, select the .pfx certificate file created earlier using the IIS Manager or OpenSSL. Specify the password, if any, that was used to secure the .pfx file. Finally, click the **Save** to upload the certificate.\n    ![ssl upload][ssluploadcert]\n9. In the **ssl bindings** section of the **SSL Settings** tab, use the dropdowns to select the domain name to secure with SSL, and the certificate to use. You may also select whether to use [Server Name Indication][sni] (SNI) or IP based SSL.\n\n    ![ssl bindings][sslbindings]\n    \n    * IP based SSL associates a certificate with a domain name by mapping the dedicated public IP address of the server to the domain name. This requires each domain name (contoso.com, fabricam.com, etc.) associated with your service to have a dedicated IP address. This is the traditional method of associating SSL certificates with a web server.\n\n    * SNI based SSL is an extension to SSL and [Transport Layer Security][tls] (TLS) that allows multiple domains to share the same IP address, with separate security certificates for each domain. Most modern browsers (including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Opera) support SNI, however older browsers may not support SNI. For more information on SNI, see the [Server Name Indication][sni] article on Wikipedia.\n\n10. Click **Save** to save the changes and enable SSL.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] If you selected **IP based SSL** and your custom domain is configured using an A record, you must perform the following additional steps:\n>\n> 1. After you have configured an IP based SSL binding, a dedicated IP address is assigned to your web app. You can find this IP address on the **Dashboard** page of your web app, in the **quick glance** section. It will be listed as **Virtual IP Address**:\n>    \n>     ![Virtual IP address](./media/configure-ssl-web-site/staticip.png)\n>    \n>     Note that this IP address will be different than the virtual IP address used previously to configure the A record for your domain. If you are configured to use SNI based SSL, or are not configured to use SSL, no address will be listed for this entry.\n>\n> 2. Using the tools provided by your domain name registrar, modify the A record for your custom domain name to point to the IP address from the previous step.\n\n\nAt this point, you should be able to visit your web app using `HTTPS://` instead of `HTTP://` to verify that the certificate has been configured correctly.\n\n##<a name=\"bkmk_enforce\"></a>Enforce HTTPS on your web app\n\nAzure App Service do *not* enforce HTTPS. Visitors may still access your web app using HTTP, which may compromise your web app's security. If you want to enforce HTTPS for your web app, you can use the **URL Rewrite** module. The URL Rewrite module is included with Azure App Service, and enables you to define rules that are applied to incoming requests before the requests are handed to your application. **It can be used for applications written in any programming language supported by Azure .** \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] .NET MVC applications should use the [RequireHttps](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.mvc.requirehttpsattribute.aspx) filter instead of URL Rewrite. For more information on using RequireHttps, see [Deploy a secure ASP.NET MVC 5 app to a web app](../article/app-service-web/web-sites-dotnet-deploy-aspnet-mvc-app-membership-oauth-sql-database.md).\n> \n> For information on programmatic redirection of requests using other programming languages and frameworks, consult the documentation for those technologies.\n\nURL Rewrite rules are defined in a **web.config** file stored in the root of your application. The following example contains a basic URL Rewrite rule that forces all incoming traffic to use HTTPS.\n\n<a name=\"example\"></a>**URL Rewrite Example Web.Config**\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <configuration>\n      <system.webServer>\n        <rewrite>\n          <rules>\n            <rule name=\"Force HTTPS\" enabled=\"true\">\n              <match url=\"(.*)\" ignoreCase=\"false\" />\n              <conditions>\n                <add input=\"{HTTPS}\" pattern=\"off\" />\n              </conditions>\n              <action type=\"Redirect\" url=\"https://{HTTP_HOST}/{R:1}\" appendQueryString=\"true\" redirectType=\"Permanent\" />\n            </rule>\n          </rules>\n        </rewrite>\n      </system.webServer>\n    </configuration>\n\nThis rule works by returning an HTTP status code of 301 (permanent redirect) when the user requests a page using HTTP. The 301 redirects the request to the same URL as the visitor requested, but replaces the HTTP portion of the request with HTTPS. For example, HTTP://contoso.com would be redirected to HTTPS://contoso.com.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] If your application is written in  **Node.js**, **PHP**, **Python Django**, or **Java**, it probably doesn't include a web.config file. However **Node.js**, **Python Django**, and **Java** all actually do use a web.config when hosted on Azure App Service- Azure creates the file automatically during deployment, so you never see it. If you include one as part of your application, it will override the one that Azure automatically generates.\n\n###.NET\n\nFor .NET applications, modify the web.config file for your application and add the **&lt;rewrite>** section from the [example](#example) to the **&lt;system.WebServer>** section.\n\nIf your web.config file already includes a **&lt;rewrite>** section, add the **&lt;rule>** from the [example](#example) as the first entry in the **&lt;rules>** section.\n\n###PHP\n\nFor PHP applications, simply save the [example](#example) as a web.config file in the root of your application, then re-deploy the application to your web app.\n\n###Node.js, Python Django, and Java\n\nA web.config file is automatically created for Node.js, Python Django, and Java apps if they don't already provide one, but it only exists on the server since it is created during deployment. The automatically generated file contains settings that tell Azure how to host your application.\n\nTo retrieve and modify the auto-generated file from the web app, use the following steps.\n\n1. Download the file using FTP (see [Uploading/downloading files over FTP and collecting diagnostics logs](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/avkashchauhan/archive/2012/06/19/windows-azure-website-uploading-downloading-files-over-ftp-and-collecting-diagnostics-logs.aspx)).\n\n2. Add it to the root of your application.\n\n3. Add the rewrite rules using the following information.\n\n    * **Node.js and Python Django**\n\n        The web.config file generated for Node.js and Python Django applications will already have a **&lt;rewrite>** section, containing **&lt;rule>** entries that are required for the proper functioning of the site. To force the site to use HTTPS, add the **&lt;rule>** from the example as the first entry in the **&lt;rules>** section. This will force HTTPS, while leaving the rest of the rules intact.\n\n    * **Java**\n    \n        The web.config file for Java applications using Apache Tomcat do not contain a **&lt;rewrite>** section, so you must add the **&lt;rewrite>** section from the example into the **&lt;system.webServer>** section.\n\n4. Redeploy the project (including the updated web.config,) to Azure\n\nOnce you deploy a web.config with a rewrite rule to force HTTPS, it should take effect immediately and redirect all requests to HTTPS.\n\nFor more information on the IIS URL Rewrite module, see the [URL Rewrite](http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) documentation. \n\n## More Resources ##\n- [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](/support/trust-center/security/)\n- [Configuration options unlocked in Azure Web Sites](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/01/28/more-to-explore-configuration-options-unlocked-in-windows-azure-web-sites/)\n- [Enable diagnostic logging](../article/app-service-web/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log.md)\n- [Configuring Web Sites](../article/app-service-web/web-sites-configure.md)\n- [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com)\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] If you want to get started with Azure App Service before signing up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751), where you can immediately create a short-lived starter web app in App Service.
