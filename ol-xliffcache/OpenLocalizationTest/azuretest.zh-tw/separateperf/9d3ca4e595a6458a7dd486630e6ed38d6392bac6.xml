It does not expect or require any schema or secondary index definitions to index data at scale. This allows you to quickly define and iterate on application data models using DocumentDB. As you add documents to a collection, DocumentDB automatically indexes all document properties so they are available for you to query. Automatic indexing allows you to store documents belonging to completely arbitrary schemas without worrying about schemas or secondary indexes.\n\nWith a goal to eliminate the impedance mismatch between the database and the application programming models, DocumentDB exploits the simplicity of JSON and its lack of a schema specification. It makes no assumptions about the documents and allows documents within a DocumentDB collection to vary in schema, in addition to the instance specific values. In contrast to other document databases, DocumentDB’s database engine operates directly at the level of JSON grammar, remaining agnostic to the concept of a document schema and blurring the boundary between the structure and instance values of documents. This, in-turn, enables it to automatically index documents without requiring schema or secondary indexes.\n\nThe indexing in DocumentDB takes advantage of the fact that JSON grammar allows documents to be **represented as trees**. For a JSON document to be represented as a tree, a dummy root node needs to be created which parents the rest of the actual nodes in the document underneath. Each label including the array indices in a JSON document becomes a node of the tree. The figure below illustrates an example JSON document and its corresponding tree representation.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] Since JSON is self-describing i.e. each document includes both schema (metadata) and data, e.g. `{\"locationId\", 5, \"city\": \"Moscow\"}` reveals that there are two properties `locationId` and `city`, and that they have a numeric and string property values. DocumentDB is able to infer the schema of documents and index them when they are inserted or replaced, without you ever having to define schemas or secondary indexes.\n\n\n**JSON Documents as Trees:**\n\n![Documents as Trees](media/documentdb-indexing/DocumentsAsTrees.png)\n\nFor example, in the example shown above:\n\n- The JSON property `{\"headquarters\": \"Belgium\"}` property in the above example corresponds to the path/headquarters/Belgium.\n- The JSON array `{\"exports\": [{\"city\": “Moscow\"}`, `{\"city\": Athens\"}]}` corresponds to the paths `/exports/[]/city/Moscow` and `/exports/[]/city/Athens`.\n\nWith automatic indexing, (1) every path in a document tree is indexed (unless the developer has explicitly configured the indexing policy to exclude certain path patterns). (2) Each update of a document to a DocumentDB collection leads to update of the structure of the index (i.e., causes addition or removal of nodes). One of the primary requirements of automatic indexing of documents is to ensure that the cost to index and query a document with deeply nested structure, say 10 levels, is the same as that of a flat JSON document consisting of key-value pairs just one level deep. Therefore a normalized path representation is the foundation upon which both automatic indexing and query subsystems are built.\n\nAn important implication of treating both the schema and instance values uniformly in terms of paths is that logically, just like the individual documents, an index of the two documents shown that keeps a map between paths and the document ids containing that path can also be represented as a tree. DocumentDB uses this fact to build an index tree which is constructed out of the union of all of the trees representing individual documents within the collection. The index tree in DocumentDB collections grows over time as new documents get added or updated to the collection.\n\n\n**DocumentDB Index as a Tree:**\n\n![Index as a Tree](media/documentdb-indexing/IndexAsTree.png)\n\nDespite being schema-free, DocumentDB’s SQL and JavaScript query languages provide relational projections and filters, hierarchical navigation across documents, and invocation of UDFs written entirely in JavaScript.
