In this tutorial, you add Microsoft account authentication to an existing project using the Live SDK. When successfully authenticated, a logged-in user is welcomed by name and the user ID value is displayed.  \n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]This tutorial demonstrates the benefits of using client-directed authentication and the Live SDK. This enables you to more easily authenticate an already logged-on user with you mobile service. You can also request additional scopes to enable your app to also access resources like OneDrive. \n>Service-directed authentication provides a more generalized experience and supports multiple authentication providers. For more information about service-directed authentication, see the topic [Add authentication to your app](mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-universal-dotnet-get-started-users.md). \n\nThis tutorial requires the following:\n\n+ [Live SDK]\n+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 3, or a later version.\n+ You must also first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services](mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started.md) or [Add Mobile Services to an existing app] tutorials.\n\n##Register your app to use Microsoft account for authentication\n\nTo be able to authenticate users, you must register your app at the Microsoft account Developer Center.

If you don't do this, you might have usage-relates issues should many customers try to start your app at the same time. For an example of how to cache this token, see [Get started with authentication](../mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-users.md#tokens)\n\n5. Comment-out or delete the call to the **RefreshTodoItems** method in the existing **OnNavigatedTo** method override.\n\n    This prevents the data from being loaded before the user is authenticated. Next, you will add a button to start the sign-in process.\n\n6. Add the following code snippet to the MainPage class:\n\n        private async void ButtonLogin_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            // Login the user and then load data from the mobile service.\n            await AuthenticateAsync();\n\n            // Hide the login button and load items from the mobile service.\n            this.ButtonLogin.Visibility = Windows.UI.Xaml.Visibility.Collapsed;\n            await RefreshTodoItems();\n        }\n        \n7. In the Windows Store app project, open the MainPage.xaml project file and add the following **Button** element just before the element that defines the **Save** button:\n\n        <Button Name=\"ButtonLogin\" Click=\"ButtonLogin_Click\" \n                        Visibility=\"Visible\">Sign in</Button>\n\n8. Repeat the previous step for the Windows Phone Store app project, but this time add the **Button** in the **TitlePanel**, after the **TextBlock** element.\n        \n9. Press the F5 key to run the app and sign into Live Connect with your Microsoft account. \n\n    When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.\n\n10. Right-click the Windows Phone Store app project, click **Set as StartUp Project**, then repeat the previous step to verify that the Windows Phone Store app also runs correctly.\n\nNow, any user authenticated by one of your registered identity providers can access the *TodoItem* table. To better secure user-specific data, you must also implement authorization. To do this you get the user ID of a given user, which can then be used to determine what level of access that user should have for a given resource.\n\n## <a name=\"next-steps\"> </a>Next steps\n\nIn the next tutorial, [Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services. For information about how to use other identity providers for authentication, see [Get started with authentication].
