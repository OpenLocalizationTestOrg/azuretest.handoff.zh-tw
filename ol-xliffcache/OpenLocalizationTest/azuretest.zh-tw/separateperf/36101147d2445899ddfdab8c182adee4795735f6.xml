Logic is applied to the update data and the cloud service records the data. If missing updates are found, they are shown on the **Updates** dashboard. You can use the **Updates** dashboard to work with missing updates and develop a plan to apply them to the servers that need them.\n\n## Use System Updates to update servers\n\nBefore you can use system updates in Microsoft Azure Operational Insights, you must have the solution installed. To read more about installing solutions, see [Use the Solutions Gallery to add or remove solutions](operational-insights-setup-workspace.md). After it is installed, you can view the updates that are missing from your monitored servers by using the **System Update Assessment** tile on the **Overview** page in Operational Insights.\n\n### To work with updates\n\n1.
