Once collected into Event Hubs, you can transform and store data using any real-time analytics provider or storage cluster.\n\nFor more information, please see [Event Hubs Overview].\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to ingest messages into an Event Hub using a console application in C, and to retrieve them in parallel using the C# [Event Processor Host] library.\n\nIn order to complete this tutorial you will need the following:\n\n+ A C development environment. For this tutorial, we will assume the gcc stack on an [Azure Linux VM](../virtual-machines-linux-tutorial.md) with Ubuntu 14.04. Instructions for other environments will be provided in external links.\n\n+ Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows\n\n+ An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes.

On the same page, take note of the generated keys for **SendRule**.\n\n    ![][6b]\n\n8. Click the **Dashboard** tab at the top of the page, and then click **Connection Information**.
