This tutorial describes how to achieve the same experience by sending sensitive information through a secure, authenticated connection between the client device and the app backend.\n\nAt a high level, the flow is as follows:\n\n1. The app back-end:\n    - Stores secure payload in back-end database.\n    - Sends the ID of this notification to the device (no secure information is sent).\n2. The app on the device, when receiving the notification:\n    - The device contacts the back-end requesting the secure payload.\n    - The app can show the payload as a notification on the device.\n\nIt is important to note that in the preceding flow (and in this tutorial), we assume that the device stores an authentication token in local storage, after the user logs in. This guarantees a completely seamless experience, as the device can retrieve the notificationâ€™s secure payload using this token. If your application does not store authentication tokens on the device, or if these tokens can be expired, the device app, upon receiving the notification should display a generic notification prompting the user to launch the app. The app then authenticates the user and shows the notification payload.\n\nThis Secure Push tutorial shows how to send a push notification securely. The tutorial builds on the **Notify Users** tutorial, so you should complete the steps in that tutorial first.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] This tutorial assumes that you have created and configured your notification hub as described in [Getting Started with Notification Hubs (iOS)](notification-hubs-ios-get-started.md).\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [notification-hubs-aspnet-backend-securepush](../../includes/notification-hubs-aspnet-backend-securepush.md)]\n\n## Modify the iOS project\n\nNow that you modified your app back-end to send just the *id* of a notification, you have to change your iOS app to handle that notification and call back your back-end to retrieve the secure message to be displayed.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we have to write the logic to retrieve the secure content from the app back-end.\n\n1. In **AppDelegate.m**, make sure the app registers for silent notifications so it processes the notification id sent from the backend. Add the **UIRemoteNotificationTypeNewsstandContentAvailability** option in didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:\n\n        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeNewsstandContentAvailability];\n\n2. In your **AppDelegate.m** add an implementation section at the top with the following declaration:\n\n        @interface AppDelegate ()\n        - (void) retrieveSecurePayloadWithId:(int)payloadId completion: (void(^)(NSString*, NSError*)) completion;\n        @end\n\n3. Then add in the implementation section the following code, substituting the placeholder `{back-end endpoint}` with the endpoint for your back-end obtained previously:\n\n```\n        NSString *const GetNotificationEndpoint = @\"{back-end endpoint}/api/notifications\";\n\n        - (void) retrieveSecurePayloadWithId:(int)payloadId completion: (void(^)(NSString*, NSError*)) completion;\n        {\n            // check if authenticated\n            ANHViewController* rvc = (ANHViewController*) self.window.rootViewController;\n            NSString* authenticationHeader = rvc.registerClient.authenticationHeader;\n            if (!authenticationHeader) return;\n\n\n            NSURLSession* session = [NSURLSession\n                                     sessionWithConfiguration:[NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration]\n                                     delegate:nil\n                                     delegateQueue:nil];\n\n\n            NSURL* requestURL = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@/%d\", GetNotificationEndpoint, payloadId]];\n            NSMutableURLRequest* request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:requestURL];\n            [request setHTTPMethod:@\"GET\"];\n            NSString* authorizationHeaderValue = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"Basic %@\", authenticationHeader];\n            [request setValue:authorizationHeaderValue forHTTPHeaderField:@\"Authorization\"];\n\n            NSURLSessionDataTask* dataTask = [session dataTaskWithRequest:request completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {\n                NSHTTPURLResponse* httpResponse = (NSHTTPURLResponse*) response;\n                if (!error && httpResponse.statusCode == 200)\n                {\n                    NSLog(@\"Received secure payload: %@\", [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]);\n\n                    NSMutableDictionary *json = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options: NSJSONReadingMutableContainers error: &error];\n\n                    completion([json objectForKey:@\"Payload\"], nil);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    NSLog(@\"Error status: %ld, request: %@\", (long)httpResponse.statusCode, error);\n                    if (error)\n                        completion(nil, error);\n                    else {\n                        completion(nil, [NSError errorWithDomain:@\"APICall\" code:httpResponse.statusCode userInfo:nil]);\n                    }\n                }\n            }];\n            [dataTask resume];\n        }\n```\n\n    This method calls your app back-end to retrieve the notification content using the credentials stored in the shared preferences.\n\n4. Now we have to handle the incoming notification and use the method above to retrieve the content to display. First, we have to enable your iOS app to run in the background when receiving a push notification. In **XCode**, select your app project on the left panel, then click your main app target in the **Targets** section from the central pane.\n\n5. Then click your **Capabilities** tab at the top of your central pane, and check the **Remote Notifications** checkbox.\n\n    ![][IOS1]\n\n\n6. In **AppDelegate.m** add the following method to handle push notifications:\n\n        -(void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler\n        {\n            NSLog(@\"%@\", userInfo);\n\n            [self retrieveSecurePayloadWithId:[[userInfo objectForKey:@\"secureId\"] intValue] completion:^(NSString * payload, NSError *error) {\n                if (!error) {\n                    // show local notification\n                    UILocalNotification* localNotification = [[UILocalNotification alloc] init];\n                    localNotification.fireDate = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:0];\n                    localNotification.alertBody = payload;\n                    localNotification.timeZone = [NSTimeZone defaultTimeZone];\n                    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] scheduleLocalNotification:localNotification];\n\n                    completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData);\n                } else {\n                    completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultFailed);\n                }\n            }];\n\n        }\n\n    Note that it is preferable to handle the cases of missing authentication header property or rejection by the back-end. The specific handling of these cases depend mostly on your target user experience. One option is to display a notification with a generic prompt for the user to authenticate to retrieve the actual notification.\n\n## Run the Application\n\nTo run the application, do the following:\n\n1. In XCode, run the app on a physical iOS device (push notifications will not work in the simulator).\n\n2. In the iOS app UI, enter a username and password. These can be any string, but they must be the same value.\n\n3. In the iOS app UI, click **Log in**. Then click **Send push**. You should see the secure notification being displayed in your notification center.\n\n[IOS1]: ./media/notification-hubs-aspnet-backend-ios-secure-push/secure-push-ios-1.png\n"
