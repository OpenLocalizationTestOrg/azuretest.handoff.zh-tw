If you need to install Azure CLI and connect it to your account first, see the [Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI)](xplat-cli.md).\n\n### Step 1: Update Azure CLI version\n\nTo use Azure CLI for imperative commands with service management mode, you should have a recent version if possible. To verify your version, type `azure --version`. You should see something like:\n\n    $ azure --version\n    0.8.17 (node: 0.10.25)\n\nIf you want to update your version of Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli).\n\n### Step 2: Set the Azure account and subscription\n\nOnce you have connected your Azure CLI with the account you want to use, you may have more than one subscription. If you do, you should review the subscriptions available for your account by typing `azure account list`, and then select the subscription you want to use by typing `azure account set <subscription id or name> true` where _subscription id or name_ is either the subscription id or the subscription name that you would like to work with in the current session. You should see something like the following:\n\n    $ azure account set \"Visual Studio Ultimate with MSDN\" true\n    info:    Executing command account set\n    info:    Setting subscription to \"Visual Studio Ultimate with MSDN\" with id \"0e220bf6-5caa-4e9f-8383-51f16b6c109f\".\n    info:    Changes saved\n    info:    account set command OK\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] If you don't already have an Azure account but you do have a subscription to MSDN subscription, you can get free Azure credits by activating your [MSDN subscriber benefits here](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) -- or you can use the free account. Either will work for Azure access.\n"
