It requires changing the SQL connection string and could result in permanent data loss. Therefore it should be done only when the outage is likely to last longer than your application's RTO. When the application is deployed to production you should perform regular monitoring of the application health and use the following data points to assert that the recovery is warranted:\n\n1. Permanent connectivity failure from the application tier to the database.\n2. Your Azure Portal shows an alert about an incident in the region with broad impact.\n\n## Failover to the Geo-Replicated secondary database\n> [AZURE.NOTE] You must configure [Standard Geo-Replication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn758204.aspx) or [Active Geo-Replication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn741339.aspx) to have a secondary database to use for failover. Geo-Replication is only available for Standard and Premium databases. \n\nIn the event of an outage on the primary database, you can failover to a secondary database to restore availability. To do this you will need to force terminate the continuous copy relationship. For a full description of terminating continuous copy relationships go [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn741323.aspx). \n\n\n\n###Azure Portal\n1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.Azure.com)\n2. On the left side of the screen select **BROWSE** and then select **SQL Databases**\n3. Navigate to your database and select it. \n4. At the bottom of your database blade select the **Geo Replication map**.\n4. Under **Secondaries** right click on the row with the name of the database you want to recover to and select **Stop**.\n\nAfter the continuous copy relationship is terminated, you can configure your recovered database to be used by following the [Finalize a Recovered Database](sql-database-recovered-finalize.md) guide.\n###PowerShell\nUse PowerShell to programmatically perform database recovery.\n\nTo terminate the relationship from the secondary database, use the [Stop-AzureSqlDatabaseCopy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn720223) cmdlet.\n        \n        $myDbCopy = Get-AzureSqlDatabaseCopy -ServerName \"SecondaryServerName\" -DatabaseName \"SecondaryDatabaseName\"\n        $myDbCopy | Stop-AzureSqlDatabaseCopy -ServerName \"SecondaryServerName\" -ForcedTermination\n         \nAfter the continuous copy relationship is terminated, you can configure your recovered database to be used by following the [Finalize a Recovered Database](sql-database-recovered-finalize.md) guide.\n###REST API \nUse REST to programmatically perform database recovery.\n\n1. Get the database continuous copy using the [Get Database Copy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn509570.aspx) operation.\n2. Stop the database continuous copy using the [Stop Database Copy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn509573.aspx) operation.\nUse the secondary server name and database name in the Stop Database Copy request URI\n\n After the continuous copy relationship is terminated, you can configure your recovered database to be used by following the [Finalize a Recovered Database](sql-database-recovered-finalize.md) guide.\n## Recovery using Geo-Restore\n\nIn the event of an outage of a database, you can recover your database from its latest geo redundant backup using Geo-Restore. \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] Recovering a database creates a new database. It is important to make sure the server you are recovering to has enough DTU capacity for the new database. You can request an increase of this quota by [contacting support](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-limits-quotas-increase-requests/).\n\n###Azure Portal\n1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.Azure.com)\n2. On the left side of the screen select **NEW**, then select **Data and Storage**, and then select **SQL Database**\n2. Select **BACKUP** as the source  and then select the geo redundant backup you want to recover from.\n3. Specify the rest of the database properties and then click **Create**.\n4. The database restore process will begin and can be monitored using **NOTIFICATIONS** on the left side of the screen.\n\nAfter the database is recovered you can configure it to be used by following the [Finalize a Recovered Database](sql-database-recovered-finalize.md) guide.\n###PowerShell \nUse PowerShell to programmatically perform database recovery.\n\nTo start a Geo-Restore request, use the [start-AzureSqlDatabaseRecovery](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn720224.aspx) cmdlet.
