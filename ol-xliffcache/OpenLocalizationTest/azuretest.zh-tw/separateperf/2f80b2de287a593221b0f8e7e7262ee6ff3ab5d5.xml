For the official APNS feature documentation, see [Apple Push Notification Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272584).\n\n##Generate the Certificate Signing Request file\n\nFirst you must generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file, which is used by Apple to generate a signed push certificate.\n\n1. From the **Utilities** folder or the **Other** folder, run the Keychain Access tool.\n\n2. Click **Keychain Access**, expand **Certificate Assistant**, then click **Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority...**.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-request-cert-from-ca.png)\n\n3. Select your **User Email Address** and **Common Name** , make sure that **Saved to disk** is selected, and then click **Continue**. Leave the **CA Email Address** field blank as it is not required.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-csr-info.png)\n\n4.

Remember the location chosen for this file.\n\nNext, you will register your app with Apple, enable push notifications, and upload this exported CSR to create a push certificate.\n\n##Register your app for push notifications\n\nTo be able to send push notifications to an iOS app, you must register your application with Apple and also register for push notifications.  \n\n1. If you have not already registered your app, navigate to the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272456\" target=\"_blank\">iOS Provisioning Portal</a> at the Apple Developer Center, log on with your Apple ID, click **Identifiers**, then click **App IDs**, and finally click on the **+** sign to register a new app.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-ios-appids.png)\n\n\n2. Type a descriptive name for your app in **App ID Description** name. \n\n    Under **Explicit App ID**, enter a **Bundle Identifier** in the form `<Organization Identifier>.<Product Name>` as mentioned in the [App Distribution Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=613485). The *Organization Identifier* and *Product Name* you use must match the organization identifier and product name you will use when you create your XCode project. In the screeshot below *NotificationHubs* is used as a organization idenitifier and *GetStarted* is used as the product name. Making sure this matches the values you will use in your XCode project will allow you to use the correct publishing profile with XCode. \n    \n    Check the **Push Notifications** option in the App Services section, and then click **Continue**.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-new-appid-info.png)\n\n    This generates your app ID and requests you to confirm the information. Click **Submit**\n\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-confirm-new-appid.png)\n\n\n    Once you click **Submit**, you will see the **Registration complete** screen, as shown below. Click **Done**.\n\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-appid-registration-complete.png)\n\n\n3. Locate the app ID that you just created, and click on its row.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-ios-appids2.png)\n\n    Clicking on the app ID will display the app details. Click the **Edit** button.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-edit-appid.png)\n\n4.

Select **iOS App Development** under **Development** as the provisiong profile type, and click **Continue**. \n\n\n3. Next, select the app ID you just created from the **App ID** drop-down list, and click **Continue**\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-select-appid-for-provisioning.png)\n\n\n4.
