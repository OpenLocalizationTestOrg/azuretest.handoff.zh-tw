Once collected into Event Hubs, you can transform and store data using any real-time analytics provider or storage cluster.\n\nFor more information, please see [Event Hubs Overview].\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to collect messages into an Event Hub using a console application in Java, and to retrieve them in parallel using Apache Storm.\n\nIn order to complete this tutorial you will need the following:\n\n+ A Java development environment configured to run [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). For this tutorial, we will assume [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).\n\n+ An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href=\"http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Free Trial</a>.\n\n## Create an Event Hub\n\n1. Log on to the [Azure management portal], and click **NEW** at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. Click **App Services**, then **Service Bus**, then **Event Hub**, and then **Quick Create**.\n\n    ![][1]\n\n3. Type a name for your Even Hub, select your desired region, and then click **Create a new Event Hub**.\n\n    ![][2]\n\n4. Click the namespace you just created (usually ***event hub name*-ns**).\n\n    ![][3]\n\n5. Click the **Event Hubs** tab at the top of the page, and then click the Event Hub you just created.\n\n    ![][4]\n\n6. Click the **Configure** tab at the top of the page, add a rule called **SendRule** with *Send* rights, add another rule called **ReceiveRule** with *Listen* rights, and then click **Save**.\n\n    ![][5]\n\n7. On the same page, take note of the generated keys for **SendRule** and **ReceiveRule**.\n\n    ![][6c]\n\nYour Event Hub is now created, and you have the connection strings you need to send and receive events.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-send-java](../../includes/service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-send-java.md)]\n\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-receive-storm](../../includes/service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-receive-storm.md)]\n\n## Run the applications\n\nNow you are ready to run the applications.\n\n1.  Run the **LogTopology** class from Eclipse, then wait for it to start the receivers for all the partitions.\n\n2.  Run the **Sender** project, press **Enter** in the console window, and see the events appear in the receiver window.\n\n    ![][22]\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] In this tutorial only, use Storm in local mode for development purposes.
