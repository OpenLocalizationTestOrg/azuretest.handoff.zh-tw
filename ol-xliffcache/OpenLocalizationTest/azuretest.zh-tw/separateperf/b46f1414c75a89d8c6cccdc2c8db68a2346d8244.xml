In other words, **Azure Data Catalog** is all about helping people discover, understand, and use data sources, and helping organizations to get more value from their existing data. Once a data source has been registered with **Azure Data Catalog**, its metadata is indexed by the service, so that users can easily search to discover the data they need.\n\n## Searching and filtering\n\nDiscovery in **Azure Data Catalog** uses two primary mechanisms: searching and filtering.\n\nSearching is designed to be both intuitive and powerful – by default, search terms are matched against any property in the catalog, including user-provided annotations.\n\nFiltering is designed to complement searching. Users can select specific characteristics such as experts, data source type, object type, and tags, to view only matching data assets, and to constrain search results to matching assets as well.\n\nBy using a combination of searching and filtering, users can quickly navigate the data sources that have been registered with **Azure Data Catalog** to discover the data sources they need.\n\n## Search syntax\n\nAlthough the default free text search is simple and intuitive, users can also use **Azure Data Catalog**’s search syntax to have greater control over the search results. **Azure Data Catalog** search supports the following techniques:\n\n| Technique                 | Use                                                                                                                                     | Example                                                   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Basic Search              | Basic search using one or more search terms.

Because all properties are searched by default, a data asset may be returned due to a match on a column-level property. And because multiple users can annotate registered data assets with their own tags and descriptions, not all metadata may be displayed in the list of search results.\n\nIn the default tile view, each tile displayed in the search results will include a “View search term matches” icon, which allows the user to quickly view the number of matches and their location, and to jump to them if desired.\n\n ![Hit highlighting and search matches in the Azure Data Catalog portal](./media/data-catalog-how-to-discover/search-matches.png)\n\n## Summary\nRegistering a data source with **Azure Data Catalog** makes that data source easier to discover and understand, by copying structural and descriptive metadata from the data source into the Catalog service.
