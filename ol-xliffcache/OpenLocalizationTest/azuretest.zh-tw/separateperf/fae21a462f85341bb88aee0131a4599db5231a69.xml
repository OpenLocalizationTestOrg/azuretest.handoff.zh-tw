This resource is where the telemetry data from your app is analyzed and displayed. \n\nYou can automate the creation of a new resource by using PowerShell.\n\nFor example, if you are developing a mobile device app, it's likely that, at any time, there will be several published versions of your app in use by your customers. You don't want to get the telemetry results from different versions mixed up. So you get your build process to create a new resource for each build.\n\n## Script to create an Application Insights resource\n\n*Output*\n\n* App Insights Name =  erimattestapp\n* IKey =  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\n\n*PowerShell Script*  \n\n```PowerShell\n\ncls\n\n\n##################################################################\n# Set Values\n##################################################################\n\n#If running manually, comment this out before the first execution to login to the Azure Portal\n#Add-AzureAccount\n\n#Set the name of the Application Insights Resource\n$appInsightsName = \"TestApp\"\n\n#Set the application name used for the value of the Tag \"AppInsightsApp\" - http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/azure-preview-portal-using-tags/\n$applicationTagName = \"MyApp\"\n\n#Set the name of the Resource Group to use.
