If it isn't, please refer to [Move data to SQL Server on Azure](machine-learning-data-science-move-sql-server-virtual-machine.md) topic in the [Advanced Data Process guide](machine-learning-data-science-advanced-data-processing.md) for instructions to move your data to a SQL Server in Azure.\n\n##<a name=\"SQL\"></a>Using SQL\n\nThis section describes several methods using SQL to perform simple random sampling against the data in the database. Please choose a method based on your data size and its distribution.\n\nThe two items below show how to use newid in SQL Server to perform the sampling. The method you choose depends on how random you want the sample to be (pk_id in the sample code below is assumed to be an auto-generated primary key).\n\n1. Less strict random sample\n\n        select  * from <table_name> where <primary_key> in \n        (select top 10 percent <primary_key> from <table_name> order by newid())\n\n2. More random sample \n\n        SELECT * FROM <table_name>\n        WHERE 0.1 >= CAST(CHECKSUM(NEWID(), <primary_key>) & 0x7fffffff AS float)/ CAST (0x7fffffff AS int)\n\nTablesample can be used for sampling as well as demonstrated below. This may be a better approach if your data size is large (assuming that data on different pages is not correlated) and for the query to complete in a reasonable time.\n\n    SELECT *\n    FROM <table_name> \n    TABLESAMPLE (10 PERCENT)\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] You can explore and generate features from this sampled data by storing it in a new table\n\n\n###<a name=\"sql-aml\"></a>Connecting to Azure Machine Learning\n\nYou can directly  use the sample queries above in the Azure ML Reader module to down-sample the data on the fly and bring it into an Azure ML experiment. A screen shot of using the reader module to read the sampled data is shown below:\n   \n![reader sql][1]\n\n##<a name=\"python\"></a>Using the Python programming language \n\nThis section demonstrates using the pyodbc library to connect to a SQL server database in Python. The database connection string is as follows: (replace servername, dbname, username and password with your configuration):\n\n    #Set up the SQL Azure connection\n    import pyodbc   \n    conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=<servername>;DATABASE=<dbname>;UID=<username>;PWD=<password>')\n\nThe [Pandas ](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library in Python provides a rich set of data structures and data analysis tools for data manipulation for Python programming. The code below reads a 0.1% sample of the data from a table in Azure SQL database into a Pandas data :\n\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    # Query database and load the returned results in pandas data frame\n    data_frame = pd.read_sql('''select column1, cloumn2... from <table_name> tablesample (0.1 percent)''', conn)\n\nYou can now work with the sampled data in the Pandas data frame. \n\n###<a name=\"python-aml\"></a>Connecting to Azure Machine Learning\n\nYou can use the following sample code to save the down-sampled data to a file and upload it to an Azure blob. The data in the blob can be directly read into an Azure ML Experiment using the *Reader Module*. The steps are as follows: \n\n1. Write the pandas data frame to a local file\n\n        dataframe.to_csv(os.path.join(os.getcwd(),LOCALFILENAME), sep='\\t', encoding='utf-8', index=False)\n\n2. Upload local file to Azure blob\n\n        from azure.storage import BlobService\n        import tables\n\n        STORAGEACCOUNTNAME= <storage_account_name>\n        LOCALFILENAME= <local_file_name>\n        STORAGEACCOUNTKEY= <storage_account_key>\n        CONTAINERNAME= <container_name>\n        BLOBNAME= <blob_name>\n\n        output_blob_service=BlobService(account_name=STORAGEACCOUNTNAME,account_key=STORAGEACCOUNTKEY)    \n        localfileprocessed = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),LOCALFILENAME) #assuming file is in current working directory\n        \n        try:\n       \n        #perform upload\n        output_blob_service.put_block_blob_from_path(CONTAINERNAME,BLOBNAME,localfileprocessed)\n        \n        except:         \n            print (\"Something went wrong with uploading blob:\"+BLOBNAME)\n\n3.
