For more information, see [Virtual Network configuration tasks](/documentation/services/virtual-network/).\n>\n> Azure HDInsight supports only location-based virtual networks, and does not currently work with virtual networks based on affinity group.\n>\n> It is highly recommended to designate a single subnet for each cluster.\n\nFor more information on provisioning an HDInsight cluster on a virtual network, see [Provisioning Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](hdinsight-provision-clusters.md).\n\n##<a id=\"tasks\"></a>Tasks and information\n\nThis section contains information on common tasks and information you may need when using HDInsight with a virtual network.\n\n###Determine the FQDN\n\nThe HDInsight cluster will be assigned a specific fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Virtual Network interface. This is the address that you should use when connecting to the cluster from other resources on the virtual network. To determine the FQDN, use the following to URL to query the Ambari management service:\n\n    https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/services/<servicename>/components/<componentname>\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] For more information on using Ambari with HDInsight, see [Monitor Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Ambari API](hdinsight-monitor-use-ambari-api.md).\n\nYou must specify the cluster name and a service and component running on the cluster, such as the YARN resource manager.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The data returned is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document that contains a lot of information about the component. To extract just the FQDN, you should use a JSON parser to retrieve the `host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name` value.\n\nFor example, to return the FQDN from an HDInsight Hadoop cluster, you can use one of the following methods to retrieve the data for the YARN resource manager:\n\n* [Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md)\n\n        $ClusterDnsName = <clustername>\n        $Username = <cluster admin username>\n        $Password = <cluster admin password>\n        $DnsSuffix = \".azurehdinsight.net\"\n        $ClusterFQDN = $ClusterDnsName + $DnsSuffix\n\n        $webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient\n        $webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)\n\n        $Url = \"https://\" + $ClusterFQDN + \"/ambari/api/v1/clusters/\" + $ClusterFQDN + \"/services/yarn/     components/resourcemanager\"\n        $Response = $webclient.DownloadString($Url)\n        $JsonObject = $Response | ConvertFrom-Json\n        $FQDN = $JsonObject.host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name\n        Write-host $FQDN\n\n* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\n\n        curl -G -u <username>:<password> https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/services/yarn/components/resourcemanager | jq .host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name\n\n###Connecting to HBase\n\nTo connect to HBase remotely by using the Java API, you must determine the ZooKeeper quorum addresses for the HBase cluster and specify this in your application.\n\nTo get the ZooKeeper quorum address, use one of the following methods to query the Ambari management service:\n\n* [Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md)\n\n        $ClusterDnsName = <clustername>\n        $Username = <cluster admin username>\n        $Password = <cluster admin password>\n        $DnsSuffix = \".azurehdinsight.net\"\n        $ClusterFQDN = $ClusterDnsName + $DnsSuffix\n\n        $webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient\n        $webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)\n\n        $Url = \"https://\" + $ClusterFQDN + \"/ambari/api/v1/clusters/\" + $ClusterFQDN + \"/configurations?type=hbase-site&tag=default&fields=items/properties/hbase.zookeeper.quorum\"\n        $Response = $webclient.DownloadString($Url)\n        $JsonObject = $Response | ConvertFrom-Json\n        Write-host $JsonObject.items[0].properties.'hbase.zookeeper.quorum'\n\n* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\n\n        curl -G -u <username>:<password> \"https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/configurations?type=hbase-site&tag=default&fields=items/properties/hbase.zookeeper.quorum\" | jq .items[0].properties[]\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] For more information on using Ambari with HDInsight, see [Monitor Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Ambari API](hdinsight-monitor-use-ambari-api.md).\n\nOnce you have the quorum information, use it in your client application.\n\nFor example, for a Java application that uses the HBase API, you would add an **hbase-site.xml** file to the project and specify the quorum information in the file as follows:\n\n```\n<configuration>\n  <property>\n    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>\n    <value>true</value>\n  </property>\n  <property>\n    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>\n    <value>zookeeper0.address,zookeeper1.address,zookeeper2.address</value>\n  </property>\n  <property>\n    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>\n    <value>2181</value>\n  </property>\n</configuration>\n```\n\n###Verify network connectivity\n\nSome services, such as SQL Server, can limit incoming network connections. This will prevent HDInsight from successfully working with these services.\n\nIf you encounter problems accessing a service from HDInsight, consult the documentation for the service to ensure that you have enabled network access. You can also verify network access by creating an Azure virtual machine on the same virtual network, and use client utilities to verify that the virtual machine can connect to the service over the virtual network.\n\n##<a id=\"nextsteps\"></a>Next steps\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to use HDInsight with Azure Virtual Network:\n\n* [Analyze sensor data with Storm and HBase in HDInsight](hdinsight-storm-sensor-data-analysis.md) - Demonstrates how to configure a Storm and HBase cluster in a virtual network, as well as how to remotely write data to HBase from Storm.\n\n* [Provision HBase clusters on Azure Virtual Network](hdinsight-hbase-provision-vnet.md) - Provides information on provisioning an HBase cluster on an Azure virtual network.\n\n* [Provision Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](hdinsight-provision-clusters.md) - Provides information on provisioning Hadoop clusters, including information on using Azure Virtual Network.\n\n* [Use Sqoop with Hadoop in HDInsight](hdinsight-use-sqoop.md) - Provides information on using Sqoop to transfer data with SQL Server over a virtual network.\n\nTo learn more about Azure virtual networks, see the [Azure Virtual Network overview](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).\n\ntest\n"
