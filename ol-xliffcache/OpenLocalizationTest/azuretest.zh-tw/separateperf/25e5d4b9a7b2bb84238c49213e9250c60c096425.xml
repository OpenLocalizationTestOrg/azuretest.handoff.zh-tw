However, SQL Data Warehouse does not support blob data types at this time. This may limit the size of your strings as blob types include both varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) types. You may find that you have used these types in your application code when building very large strings of dynamic SQL code you need to execute. \n\nIn these situations you will need to break the code into chunks and use the EXEC statement instead. \n\nA simplified example is available below:\n\n```\nDECLARE @sql_fragment1 VARCHAR(8000)=' SELECT name '\n,       @sql_fragment2 VARCHAR(8000)=' FROM sys.system_views '\n,       @sql_fragment3 VARCHAR(8000)=' WHERE name like ''%table%''';\n\nEXEC( @sql_fragment1 + @sql_fragment2 + @sql_fragment3);\n```\n\nIf the string is not particularly long then you can use [sp_executesql][] as normal.\n\n\n## Next steps\nFor more development tips, see [development overview][].\n\n<!--Image references-->\n\n<!--Article references-->\n[development overview]: sql-data-warehouse-overview-develop.md\n\n<!--MSDN references-->\n[sp_executesql]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188001.aspx\n\n<!--Other Web references-->\n"
