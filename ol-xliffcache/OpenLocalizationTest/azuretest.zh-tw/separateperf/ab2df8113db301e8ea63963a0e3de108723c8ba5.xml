Here are some tips.\n\n\n## Build errors\n\n*In Eclipse, when adding the Application Insights SDK via Maven or Gradle, I get build or checksum validation errors.*\n\n* If the dependency <version> element is using a pattern with wildcard characters (e.g. (Maven) `<version>[0.9,)</version>` or (Gradle) `version:'0.9.+'`), try specifying a specific version instead like `0.9.3`.\n\n## No data \n\n*I added Application Insights successfully and ran my app, but I've never seen data in the portal.*\n\n* Wait a minute and click Refresh. The charts refresh themselves periodically, but you can also refresh manually. The refresh interval depends on the time range of the chart.\n* Check that you have an instrumentation key defined in the ApplicationInsights.xml file (in the resources folder in your project)\n* Verify that there is no `<DisableTelemetry>true</DisableTelemetry>` node in the xml file.\n* In your firewall, you might have to open TCP ports 80 and 443 for outgoing traffic to dc.services.visualstudio.com and f5.services.visualstudio.com.\n* In the Microsoft Azure start board, look at the service status map. If there are some alert indications, wait until they have returned to OK and then close and re-open your Application Insights application blade.\n* Turn on logging to the IDE console window, by adding an `<SDKLogger />` element under the root node in the ApplicationInsights.xml file (in the resources folder in your project), and check for entries prefaced with [Error].\n* Make sure that the correct ApplicationInsights.xml file has been successfully loaded by the Java SDK, by looking at the console's output messages for a \"Configuration file has been successfully found\" statement.\n* If the config file is not found, check the output messages to see where the config file is being searched for, and make sure that the ApplicationInsights.xml is located in one of those search locations. As a rule of thumb, you can place the config file near the Application Insights SDK JARs. For example: in Tomcat, this would mean the WEB-INF/lib folder.\n\n\n\n#### I used to see data, but it has stopped\n\n* Check the [status blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/applicationinsights-status/).\n* Have you hit your monthly quota of data points? Open Settings/Quota and Pricing to find out. If so, you can upgrade your plan, or pay for additional capacity. See the [pricing scheme](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/application-insights/).\n\n\n\n## No usage data\n\n*I see data about requests and response times, but no page view, browser, or user data.*\n\nYou successfully set up your app to send telemetry from the server. Now your next step is to [set up your web pages to send telemetry from the web browser][usage].\n\nAlternatively, if your client is an app in a [phone or other device][platforms], you can send telemetry from there. \n\nUse the same instrumentation key to set up both your client and server telemetry. The data will appear in the same Application Insights resource, and you'll be able to correlate events from client and server.\n\n\n\n## Disabling telemetry\n\n*How can I disable telemetry collection?*\n\nIn code:\n\n    TelemetryConfiguration config = TelemetryConfiguration.getActive();\n    config.setTrackingIsDisabled(true);\n\n\n**Or** \n\nUpdate ApplicationInsights.xml (in the resources folder in your project). Add the following under the root node:\n\n    <DisableTelemetry>true</DisableTelemetry>\n\nUsing the XML method, you have to restart the application when you change the value.\n\n## Changing the target\n\n*How can I change which Azure resource my project sends data to?*\n\n* [Get the instrumentation key of the new resource.][java]\n* If you added Application Insights to your project using the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse, right click your web project, select **Azure**, **Configure Application Insights**, and change the key.\n* Otherwise, update the key in ApplicationInsights.xml in the resources folder in your project.\n\n\n## The Azure start screen\n\n*I'm looking at [the Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).
