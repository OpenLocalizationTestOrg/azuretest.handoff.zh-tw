Previously, you could only add RFC 1918 address blocks (private space) to your VNets. When you add a public IP address range, it will be treated as part of the private VNet IP address space that is only reachable within the VNet, interconnected VNets, and from your on-premises location.\n\nAdding a public IP address space works conceptually like this:\n\n![Public IP Conceptual](./media/virtual-networks-public-ip-within-vnet/IC775683.jpg)\n\n## How do I add a public IP address range?\n\nYou add a public IP address range the same way you would add a private IP address range; by either using a *netcfg* file, or making the configuration in the portal. You can add a public IP address range when you create your VNet, or you can go back and add it afterward. The example below shows both public and private IP address space configured in the same virtual network.\n\n![Public IP Address in Portal](./media/virtual-networks-public-ip-within-vnet/IC775684.png)\n\n## Are there any limitations?\n\nThere are a few IP address ranges that are not allowed:\n\n- 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast)\n\n- 255.255.255.255/32 (Broadcast)\n\n- 127.0.0.0/8 (loopback)\n\n- 169.254.0.0/16 (link-local)\n\n- 68.63.129.16/32 (Internal DNS)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n[How to manage Virtual Network (VNet) Properties](../virtual-networks-settings)\n\n[How to manage DNS servers used by a virtual network (VNet)](../virtual-networks-manage-dns-in-vnet)\n\n[How to delete a Virtual Network (VNet)](../virtual-networks-delete-vnet) "
