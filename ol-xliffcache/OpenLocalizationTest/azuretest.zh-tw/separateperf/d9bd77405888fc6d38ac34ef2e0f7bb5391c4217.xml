To view the history, click on **Browse** at the left side of the portal screen and select **Logic Apps**. A list of Logic Apps in your subscription will appear. A Logic App can be **Enabled** or **Disabled**. **Enabled** Logic Apps means that triggers will run your Logic App in response to trigger events, **Disabled** Logic App will not run in response to events.\n\n![Overview](./media/app-service-logic-monitor-your-logic-apps/overview.png)\n\nWhen the blade for your Logic App appears, there are 2 sections that are useful:\n\n- **Summary**, which tells you the latest status and is an entry point to editing your Logic App.\n- **All runs**, which shows you a list of the runs this Logic App has had.\n\n##Runs\n\n![All Runs](./media/app-service-logic-monitor-your-logic-apps/allruns.png)\n\nThis list of runs shows the **Start time**, the **Run identifier** (you can use this when calling the REST API), and the **Duration** of the particular runs.
