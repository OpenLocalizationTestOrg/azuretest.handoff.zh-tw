With this information, a directory admin can better determine where possible security risks may lie so that they can adequately plan to mitigate those risks.\n\nIn the Azure Management Portal, reports are categorized in the following ways:\n\n- Anomaly reports – Contain sign in events that we found to be anomalous. Our goal is to make you aware of such activity and enable you to be able to make a determination about whether an event is suspicious.\n- Integrated Application reports – Provides insights into how cloud applications are being used in your organization. Azure Active Directory offers integration with thousands of cloud applications.\n- Error reports – Indicate errors that may occur when provisioning accounts to external applications.\n- User-specific reports – Display device/sign in activity data for a specific user.\n- Activity logs – Contain a record of all audited events within the last 24 hours, last 7 days, or last 30 days, as well as group activity changes, and password reset and registration activity.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE]\n>\n- Some advanced anomaly and resource usage reports are only available when you enable [Azure Active Directory Premium](active-directory-get-started-premium.md). Advanced reports help you improve access security, respond to potential threats and get access to analytics on device access and application usage.\n- Azure Active Directory Premium and Basic editions are available for customers in China using the worldwide instance of Azure Active Directory. Azure Active Directory Premium and Basic editions are not currently supported in the Microsoft Azure service operated by 21Vianet in China.
