Regardless of the size of your organization, you need a robust, secure, and scalable platform to drive your business , your brand awareness, and your customer communications. App Service Web Apps can help maintain your corporate brand and identity with Microsoft backed business continuity.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] If you want to get started with Azure App Service before signing up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751), where you can immediately create a short-lived starter web app in App Service. No credit cards required; no commitments.\n\nBelow is an example of a .COM website running on App Service Web Apps. It demonstrates what you can do simply by composing Web Apps together with other services with minimal technical investments. **Click on an element in the topography to read more about it.** \n\n<object type=\"image/svg+xml\" data=\"https://sidneyhcontent.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/corp-website-visio.svg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></object>\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE]\n> This guide presents some of the most common areas and tasks that are aligned with running a public-facing .COM site in Azure App Service Web Apps. However, there are other common solutions that you can implement in Azure App Service Web Apps. To review these solutions, see the other guides on [Digital Marketing Campaigns](web-sites-digital-marketing-application-solution-overview.md) and [Business Applications](web-sites-business-application-solution-overview.md).\n\n## Create from scratch or bring existing assets\n\nQuickly create new sites from a popular CMS in the gallery or bring your existing web assets to App Service Web Apps from a variety of languages and frameworks.\n\nThe Azure Marketplace provides templates from the popular website content management systems (CMS), such as [Orchard], [Umbraco], Drupal, and [WordPress]. You can create a web app using your favorite CMS flavor. You can choose from various database backends to meet your needs, including [Azure SQL Database] and [MySQL].\n\nYour existing web assets can run on App Service Web Apps, whether they are .NET, PHP, Java, Node.js, or Python. You can move them to Web Apps using your familiar [FTP] tools or your source control management system. Web Apps supports direct publishing from popular source control options, such as [Visual Studio], [Visual Studio Online], and [Git] - local, GitHub, BitBucket, DropBox, Mercurial, etc..\n\n## Publish reliably\n\nPublish your website reliably by continuously publishing directly from your existing source control system and live-testing your content. \n\nDuring the planning, prototyping, and early development of a site, you can look at real working versions of the website before it goes live by [deploying to a staging slot] of your site on App Service Web Apps. By integrating source control with Web Apps, you can [continuously publish] to a staging slot, and swap it into production with no downtime when you are ready to do so. If anything goes wrong on the production site, you can also swap it out for a previous version of your site immediately. \n\nAlso, when planning changes to a live website, you can easily [run A/B tests] on the proposed updates using the Test in Production feature in and analyze real user behavior to help you make informed decisions on site design.\n\n## Brand and secure\n\nUse the App Service Web Apps domain for free or map to your registered domain name, then secure your brand with your CA-signed SSL certificate.\n\nThe **\\*.azurewebsites.net** domain is complimentary when you run your website on Web Apps. Or, you can map your website to a [custom domain] - e.g. contoso.com - which you obtained from any DNS registry, such as GoDaddy.\n\nIf you collect any user information, perform ecommerce, or manage any other sensitive data, you can protect your brand reputation and your customers with [HTTPS]. The **\\*.azurewebsites.net** domain name already comes with an SSL certificate, and if you use your custom domain, you can bring your SSL certificate for it to Web Apps. There is a monthly charge (prorated hourly) associated with each SSL certificate. For more information, see [App Service Pricing Details].\n\n## Go global\n\nGo global by serving regional sites with Azure Traffic Manager and delivering content lightning fast with Azure CDN.\n\nTo serve global customers in their respective regions, use [Azure Traffic Manager] to route site visitors to a regional site that provides the best performance. Alternatively, you can spread the site load evenly across multiple copies of your website hosted in multiple regions.\n\nDeliver your static content lightning fast to users globally by [integrating your web app with Azure CDN]. Azure CDN caches static content in the [CDN node] closest to the user, which minimizes latency and connections to your website.\n\n## Optimize\n\nOptimize your .COM site by scaling automatically with Autoscale, caching with Azure Redis Cache, running background tasks with WebJobs, and maintaining high availability with Azure Traffic Manager.\n\nThe ability of App Service Web Apps to [scale up and out] meets the need of your .COM site, regardless of the size of your workload. Scale out your website manually through the [Azure preview portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529715), programmatically through the [Service Management API] or [PowerShell scripting], or automatically through the Autoscale feature. In **Standard** hosting plan, Autoscale enables you to scale out a website automatically based on CPU utilization. For best practices, see [Troy Hunt]'s [10 things I learned about rapidly scaling web apps with Azure].\n\nMake your website more responsive with the [Azure Redis Cache]. Use it to cache data from backend databases and other things such as the [ASP.NET session state] and [output cache].\n\nMaintain high availability of your website using [Azure Traffic Manager]. Using the **Failover** method, Traffic Manager automatically routes traffic to a secondary site if there is a problem on the primary site.\n\n## Monitor and analyze\n\nStay up-to-date on your website's performance with Azure or third-party tools. Receive alerts on critical website events. Gain user insight easily with Application Insight or with web log analytics from HDInsight. \n\nGet a [quick glance] of the website's current performance metrics and resource quotas in the web app's blade in the [Azure preview portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529715). For a 360° view of your application across availability, performance and usage, use [Azure Application Insights] to give you fast & powerful troubleshooting, diagnostics and usage insights. Or, use a third-party tool like [New Relic] to provide advanced monitoring data for your websites.\n\nIn the **Standard** hosting plan, monitor site responsiveness receive email notifications whenever your site becomes unresponsive. For more information, see [How to: Receive Alert Notifications and Manage Alert Rules in Azure].\n\n## Use rich media and reach all devices\n\nMake your .COM site attractive with rich media, such as:\n\n-  Upload and stream videos globally with [Azure Media Services]\n-  Send emails to users with [SendGrid service in Azure Marketplace]\n\n## More Resources\n\n- [App Service Web Apps Documentation](/services/app-service/web/)\n- [Learning Map for Azure App Service Web Apps](websites-learning-map.md)\n- [Azure Web Blog](/blog/topics/web/)\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-web-whats-changed](../../includes/app-service-web-whats-changed.md)]\n\n\n[Azure App Service]: /services/app-service/web/\n\n[Orchard]:web-sites-dotnet-orchard-cms-gallery.md\n[Umbraco]:web-sites-gallery-umbraco.md\n[WordPress]:web-sites-php-web-site-gallery.md\n[MySQL]:web-sites-php-mysql-deploy-use-git.md\n[Azure SQL Database]:web-sites-dotnet-deploy-aspnet-mvc-app-membership-oauth-sql-database.md\n[FTP]:web-sites-deploy.md#ftp\n[Visual Studio]:web-sites-dotnet-get-started.md\n[Visual Studio Online]:../cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso.md\n[Git]:web-sites-publish-source-control.md\n\n[deploying to a staging slot]:web-sites-staged-publishing.md \n[continuously publish]:http://rickrainey.com/2014/01/21/continuous-deployment-github-with-azure-web-sites-and-staged-publishing/\n[run A/B tests]:http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tomholl/archive/2014/11/10/a-b-testing-with-azure-websites.aspx\n\n[custom domain]:web-sites-custom-domain-name.md\n[HTTPS]:web-sites-configure-ssl-certificate.md\n[App Service Pricing Details]: /pricing/details/app-service/#ssl-connections\n\n[Azure Traffic Manager]:http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CloudPowerHowToScaleAzureWebsitesGloballyWithTrafficManager.aspx\n[integrating your web app with Azure CDN]:cdn-websites-with-cdn.md \n[CDN node]:https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/gg680302.aspx\n\n[scale up and out]:web-sites-scale.md\n[Azure Management Portal]:http://manage.windowsazure.com/\n[Service Management API]:https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee460799.aspx\n[PowerShell scripting]:https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj152841.aspx\n[Troy Hunt]:https://twitter.com/troyhunt\n[10 things I learned about rapidly scaling web apps with Azure]:http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/09/10-things-i-learned-about-rapidly.html\n[Azure Redis Cache]:/blog/2014/06/05/mvc-movie-app-with-azure-redis-cache-in-15-minutes/\n[ASP.NET session state]:https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn690522.aspx\n[output cache]:https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798898.aspx\n\n[quick glance]:web-sites-monitor.md\n[Azure Application Insights]:http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/01/07/application-insights-and-azure-websites.aspx\n[New Relic]:../store-new-relic-cloud-services-dotnet-application-performance-management.md\n[How to: Receive Alert Notifications and Manage Alert Rules in Azure]:http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/dn306638.aspx\n\n[Azure Media Services]:http://blogs.technet.com/b/cbernier/archive/2013/09/03/windows-azure-media-services-and-web-sites.aspx\n[SendGrid service in Azure Marketplace]:sendgrid-dotnet-how-to-send-email.md\n\n \n\ntest\n"
