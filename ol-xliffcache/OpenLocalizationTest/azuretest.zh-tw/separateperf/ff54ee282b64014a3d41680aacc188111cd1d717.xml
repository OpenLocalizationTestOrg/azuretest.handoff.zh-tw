The results generated by the web service are displayed at the bottom of the dashboard.\n\n![Test the web service](./media/machine-learning-publish-a-machine-learning-web-service/figure-3.png)\n\nOn the **CONFIGURATION** tab you can change the display name of the service and give it a description. The name and description is displayed in the Azure Management Portal where you manage your web services.\nYou can also enable logging to diagnose any failures that you're seeing when hitting your web service. For more information, see [Enable logging for Machine Learning web services](machine-learning-web-services-logging.md).\n\n![Configure the web service](./media/machine-learning-publish-a-machine-learning-web-service/figure-4.png)\n\nYou can also provide a description for your input data, output data, and web service parameters by providing entering a string for each column under **INPUT SCHEMA**, **OUTPUT SCHEMA**, and **WEB SERVICE PARAMETER**. These descriptions are used in the sample code documentation provided for the web service.\n\n##Access the web service\n\nOnce you publish your web service from Machine Learning Studio, you can send data to the service and receive responses programmatically.\n\nThe dashboard provides all the information you need to access your web service. For example, the API key is provided to allow authorized access to the service, and API help pages are provided to help you get started writing your code.\n\nFor more information about accessing a Machine Learning web service, see [How to consume a published Azure Machine Learning web service](machine-learning-consume-web-services.md).\n\n\n##Manage the web service in the Azure Management Portal\n\nIn the Azure Management Portal, you can manage your web services by clicking the **Machine Learning** service, opening your Machine Learning workspace, and then opening the web service from the **WEB SERVICES** tab. From this page you can monitor the web service, update it, and delete it. You can also add a second endpoint for your web service in addition to the default endpoint that is created when you publish it.\n\nFor more information, see [Manage an Azure Machine Learning workspace](machine-learning-manage-workspace.md).\n<!-- When this article gets published, fix the link and uncomment\nFor more information on how to manage Azure Machine Learning web service endpoints using the REST API, see **Azure machine learning web service endpoints**. \n-->\n\n\n##Update the web service\n\nYou can make changes to your web service, such as updating the model with additional training data, and publish it again, overwriting the original web service.\n\nTo update the web service, open the original scoring experiment you used to publish the original web service and make an editable copy by clicking **SAVE AS**. Make your changes and then click **PUBLISH WEB SERVICE**. Because you've published this experiment before, Machine Learning Studio prompts you to ask if you want to overwrite the existing service. If you click **YES**, then the existing web service is stopped and the new scoring experiment is published in its place.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] If you made configuration changes in the original web service, for example, entering a new display name or description, you will need to enter those values again.\n\nOne option for updating your web service is to retrain the model programmatically. For more information, see [Retrain Machine Learning models programmatically](machine-learning-retrain-models-programmatically.md). \ntest\n"
