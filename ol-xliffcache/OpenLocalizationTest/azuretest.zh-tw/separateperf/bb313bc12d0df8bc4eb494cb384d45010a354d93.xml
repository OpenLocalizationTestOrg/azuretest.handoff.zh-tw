Before going into any depth let's look at an example of one:\n\n    ```\n    SELECT *\n    FROM sys.tables\n    OPTION (LABEL = 'My Query Label')\n    ;\n    ```\n\nThis last line tags the string 'My Query Label' to the query. This is particularly helpful as the label is query-able through the DMVs. This provides us with a mechanism to track down problem queries and also to help identify progress through an ETL run. \n\nA good naming convention really helps here. For example something like ' PROJECT : PROCEDURE : STATEMENT : COMMENT' would help to uniquely identify the query in amongst all the code in source control.\n\nTo search by label you can use the following query that uses the dynamic management views:\n\n    ```\n    SELECT  *\n    FROM    sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r\n    WHERE   r.[label] = 'My Query Label'\n    ;\n    ``` \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] It is essential that you wrap square brackets or double quotes around the word label when querying. Label is a reserved word and will caused an error if it has not been delimited.\n\n\n## Next steps\nFor more development tips, see [development overview][].\n\n<!--Image references-->\n\n<!--Article references-->\n[development overview]: sql-data-warehouse-overview-develop.md\n\n<!--MSDN references-->\n\n<!--Other Web references-->\n\n\n\n"
