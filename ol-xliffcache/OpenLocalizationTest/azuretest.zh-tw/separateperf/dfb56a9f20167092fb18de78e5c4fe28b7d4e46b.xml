These subsystems layered together allow application developers to write service fabric applications that are: \n\n* highly available, \n* scalable, \n* easily manageable and \n* easy to test.\n\nThe following picture shows the architecture and major subsystems of Service Fabric.\n\n![](media/service-fabric-architecture/service-fabric-architecture.png)\n\nIn a distributed system, the ability to securely communicate between different nodes is crucial. At the bottom of the stack is transport subsystem, which provides the ability to securely communicate between the different nodes. Above the transport subsystem lies the federation subsystem, which clusters the different nodes into a single entity (named clusters) so that the system can detect failures, perform leader election and route consistenty. The reliability subsystem, layered on top of the federation subsystem is responsible for the high reliability of Service Fabric services through mechanisms such as replication, resource management and failover management. The federation subsystem also underlies the Hosting subsystem, which manages the lifecycle of an application on a single node. The cluster management subsystem manages the multi-machine lifecycle of applications and services. The testability subsystem allows the application developer to test their services through simulated faults before deploying applications and services to production environments.  Service Fabric also provides the ability to resolve service locations through its communication subsystem. The application programming model exposed to developers is layered on top of these susbsystems.\n\n## Transport subsystem\nThe transport subsystem implements a point-to-point datagram communication channel. This channel is used for communication within service fabric cluster and communication between service fabric cluster and clients. It supports one-way and request-reply communication pattern, which provides the basis for implementing broadcast and multicast in upper layers. The transport subsystem secures communication by using X509 certificates or Windows security. This subsystem is used internally by Service Fabric and is not directly accessible to the developers for application programming.\n\n## Federation subsystem\nIn order to reason about a set of nodes in a distributed system, we need to have a consistent view of the system. The federation subsystem uses the communication primitives provided by the transport subsystem and stitches the various nodes into a single unified system that it can reason about. It provides the distributed systems primitives needed by the other subsystems - failure detection, leader election, and consistent routing. The federation subsystem is built on top of Distributed Hash Tables with a 128 bit token space and creates a ring topology over the nodes, with each node in the ring being allocated a subset of the token space for ownership. For failure detection, the layer uses a leasing mechanism based on heart beating and arbitration. The federation subsystem also guarantees through intricate join and departure protocols that only a single owner of a token exists at any time. This allows us to provide leader election and consistent routing guarantees. \n\n## Reliability subsystem\nThe reliability subsystem provides the mechanism to make the state of a Service Fabric service highly available through the use of the _replicator_, the _failover manager_, and, the _resource balancer_.\n\n* The Replicator ensures that state changes in the primary service replica will automatically be replicated to secondary replicas, maintaining consistency between the primary and secondary replicas in a service replica set. The Replicator is responsible for quorum management among the replicas in the replica-set. It interacts with the failover unit to get the list of operations to replicate and the reconfiguration agent (RA) provides it with the configuration of the replica-set, which indicates which replicas the operations need to be replicated to. Service Fabric provides a default replicator called Fabric Replicator, which can be used by service developers to make service state highly available and reliable.\n* The Failover Manager ensures that when nodes are added to or removed from the cluster, load is automatically redistributed across the available nodes. If a node in the cluster fails, the cluster will automatically reconfigure the service replicas so that there will be no loss of availability.\n* The Resource Balancer places service replicas across failure domain in the cluster and ensures that all failover units are operational. The Resource Balancer also resource balances services across the underlying shared pool of cluster nodes to achieve optimal uniform load distribution.\n\n## Management subsystem\nThe management subsystem provides end-to-end service and application lifecycle management. PowerShell Cmdlets and administrative APIs enable you to provision, deploy, patch, upgrade, and de-provision applications without loss of availability. The management subsystem performs this through the following services.\n\n* Cluster Manager - This is the primary service that interacts with the Failover Manager from reliability to place the applications with the various nodes based on the service placement constraints. The resource balancer in failover ensures that the constraints are never broken. The cluster manager manages the life-cycle of the applications from provision to de-provision. It integrates with the health manager described in the next step to ensure that application availability is not lost from a semantic health perspective during upgrades.\n* Health Manager - This services enables health monitoring of applications and services and cluster entities. Cluster entities (such as nodes, service partitions, and replicas) can report health information, which is then aggregated into the centralized Health Store. This health information provides an overall point-in-time health snapshot of the services and nodes distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster, allowing you to take any needed corrective actions. Health Query APIs enable you to query the health events reported to the Health subsystem. The Health Query APIs return the raw health data stored in the Health Store or the aggregated, interpreted health data for a specific cluster entity.\n* Image Store - This service allows for the storage and distribution of the application binaries. This service provides simple distributed file store where the applications are uploaded to and downloaded from.\n\n\n## Hosting subsystem\nThe cluster manager informs the hosting subsystem (running on each node) which services it needs to manage for a particular node. The hosting subsytem then manages the lifecycle of the application on that node. It interacts with the reliability and health components to ensure that the replicas are properly placed and are healthy.\n\n## Communication subsystem\nThis subsystem provides reliable messaging within the cluster and service discovery through the Naming service. The Naming service resolves service names to a location in the cluster and allows users to manage service names and properties. Using the Naming service, clients can securely communicate with any node in the cluster to resolve a service name and retrieve service metadata. Using a simple Naming Client API, users of Service Fabric can develop services and clients capable of resolving the current network location despite node dynamism or size of the cluster.\n\n## Testability subsystem\nTestability is a suite of tools specifically designed for testing services built on  Service Fabric. The tools allow the developer to easily induce meaningful faults and run test scenarios to exercise and validate the numerous different states and transitions a service will experience throughout its lifetime, all in a controlled and safe manner. Testability also provides a mechanism to run long running tests that can iterate through various possible failures without losing availability providing users with a Test In Production environment.\n "
