All metadata remains within that region.\n- **Metadata**-No application data is send to Azure. Site Recovery only needs metadata such as virtual machine and VMM cloud names, in order to orchestrate replication and failover. \n- **Connection to Azure**-Management servers communicate with Azure depending on your deployment scenario. For example if you're replicating virtual machines located in an on-premises VMM cloud, the VMM server communicates with Site Recovery over an encrypted outbound HTTPS connection. No connection is required from the virtual machines or Hyper-V hosts.\n- **Hyper-V Replica**-Azure Site Recovery leverages Hyper-V Replica for the replication process, and can also use SAN replication if you're replicating between two on-premises VMM sites. Site Recovery uses smart replication, replicating only data blocks and not the entire VHD for the initial replication. For ongoing replication only delta changes are replicated. Site Recovery supports offline data transfer and works with WAN optimizers.\n- **Pricing**-You can [Read more](pricing/details/site-recovery) about Site Recovery pricing.\n\n\n## Deployment scenarios\n\nThis table summarizes the replication scenarios supported by Site Recovery.\n\n**Replicate to** | **Replicate from (on-premises)** | **Details** | **Article**\n---|---|---|---\nAzure | Hyper-V site | Replicate virtual machine on one or more on-premises Hyper-V host servers that are defined as a Hyper-V site to Azure.
