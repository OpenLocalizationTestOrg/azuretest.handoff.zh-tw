We have the following actors:\n\n* Processor responsible for calculating Pi using PoolTask Actors.\n\n* PoolTask responsible for Monte Carlo simulation and sending results to Aggregator.\n\n* Aggregator responsible for, well, aggregating results and sending them to Finaliser.\n\n* Finaliser responsible for calculating the final result and printing on screen.\n\n## Distributed computation code sample – Monte Carlo simulation\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IProcessor : IActor\n{\n    Task ProcessAsync(int tries, int seed, int taskCount);\n}\n\npublic class Processor : Actor, IProcessor\n{\n    public Task ProcessAsync(int tries, int seed, int taskCount)\n    {\n        var tasks = new List<Task>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < taskCount; i++)\n        {\n            var task = ActorProxy.Create<IPooledTask>(0); // stateless\n            tasks.Add(task.CalculateAsync(tries, seed));\n        }\n        return Task.WhenAll(tasks);\n    }\n}\n\npublic interface IPooledTask : IActor\n{\n    Task CalculateAsync(int tries, int seed);\n}\n\npublic class PooledTask : Actor, IPooledTask\n{\n    public Task CalculateAsync(int tries, int seed)\n    {\n        var pi = new Pi()\n        {\n            InCircle = 0,\n            Tries = tries\n        };\n\n        var random = new Random(seed);\n        double x, y;\n        for (int i = 0; i < tries; i++)\n        {\n            x = random.NextDouble();\n            y = random.NextDouble();\n            if (Math.Sqrt(x * x + y * y) <= 1)\n                pi.InCircle++;\n        }\n\n        var agg = ActorProxy.Create<IAggregator>(ActorId.NewId());\n        return agg.AggregateAsync(pi);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA common way of aggregating results in Azure Service Fabric is to use timers. We are using stateless actors for two main reasons: the runtime will decide how many aggregators are needed dynamically, therefore giving us scale on demand; and it will instantiate these actors “locally” – in other words in the same silo of the calling actor, reducing network hops.\nHere is how the Aggregator and Finaliser look:\n\n## Distributed computation code sample – aggregator\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IAggregator : IActor\n{\n    Task AggregateAsync(Pi pi);\n}\n\n[DataContract]\nclass AggregatorState\n{\n    [DataMember]\n    public Pi _pi;\n    [DataMember]\n    public bool _pending;\n}\n\npublic class Aggregator : Actor<AggregatorState>, IAggregator\n{\n    public override Task OnActivateAsync()\n    {\n        State._pi = new Pi() { InCircle = 0, Tries = 0 };\n        State._pending = false;\n\n        this.RegisterTimer(\n            ProcessAsync,\n            null,\n            TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),\n            TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));\n\n        return base.OnActivateAsync();\n    }\n\n    private async Task ProcessAsync(object obj)\n    {\n        if (false == _pending)\n            return;\n\n        var finaliser = ActorProxy.Create<IFinaliser>(0);\n        await finaliser.FinaliseAsync(_pi);\n        State._pending = false;\n        State._pi.InCircle = 0;\n        State._pi.Tries = 0;\n    }\n\n    public Task AggregateAsync(Pi pi)\n    {\n        State._pi.InCircle += pi.InCircle;\n        State._pi.Tries += pi.Tries;\n        State._pending = true;\n        return TaskDone.Done;\n    }\n}\n\npublic interface IFinaliser : IActor\n{\n    Task FinaliseAsync(Pi pi);\n}\n\n[DataContract]\nclass FinalizerState\n{\n    [DataMember]\n    public Pi _pi;\n}\n\npublic class Finaliser : Actor<FinalizerState>, IFinaliser\n{\n    public override Task OnActivateAsync()\n    {\n        State._pi = new Pi()\n        {\n            InCircle = 0,\n            Tries = 0\n        };\n\n        return base.OnActivateAsync();\n    }\n\n    public Task FinaliseAsync(Pi pi)\n    {\n        State._pi.InCircle += pi.InCircle;\n        State._pi.Tries += pi.Tries;\n        Console.WriteLine(\" Pi = {0:N9}  T = {1:N0}, {2}\",(double)State._pi.InCircle / (double)State._pi.Tries * 4.0, State._pi.Tries, State._pi.InCircle);\n\n        return TaskDone.Done;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAt this point, it should be clear how we could potentially enhance the Leaderboard example with an aggregator for scale and performance.\n\nWe are by no means asserting that Azure Service Fabric is a drop-in replacement for other distributed computation of big data frameworks or high performance computing. There are some things it is just built to handle better than others. However one can model workflows and distributed parallel computation in Azure Service Fabric while still getting the simplicity benefits it provides.\n\n## Next Steps\n[Pattern: Smart Cache](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-smart-cache.md)\n\n[Pattern: Distributed Networks and Graphs](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-distributed-networks-and-graphs.md)\n\n[Pattern: Resource Governance](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-resource-governance.md)\n\n[Pattern: Stateful Service Composition](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-stateful-service-composition.md)\n\n[Pattern: Internet of Things](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-internet-of-things.md)\n\n[Some Anti-patterns](service-fabric-reliable-actors-anti-patterns.md)\n\n[Introduction to Service Fabric Actors](service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction.md)\n\n\n<!--Image references-->\n[1]: ./media/service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-distributed-computation/distributed-computation-1.png\n"
