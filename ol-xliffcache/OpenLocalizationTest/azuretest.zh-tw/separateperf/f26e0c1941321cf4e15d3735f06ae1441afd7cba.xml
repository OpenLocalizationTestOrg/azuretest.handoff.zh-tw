In both cases, the disks are actually .vhd files that reside in an Azure storage account. Also in both cases, after you attach the disk, you'll need to initialize it so it's ready for use.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] It's a best practice to use one or more separate disks to store a virtual machine's data. When you create an Azure virtual machine, it has a disk for the operating system mapped to drive C and a temporary disk mapped to drive D. **Do not use drive D to store data.** As the name implies, drive D provides temporary storage only. It offers no redundancy or backup because it doesn't reside in Azure Storage.\n\n## Video walkthrough\n\nHere's a walkthrough of the steps in this tutorial.\n\n[AZURE.VIDEO attaching-a-data-disk-to-a-windows-vm] \n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [howto-attach-disk-windows-linux](../../includes/howto-attach-disk-windows-linux.md)]\n\n## <a id=\"initializeinWS\"></a>How to: initialize a new data disk in Windows Server\n\n1. Connect to the virtual machine. For instructions, see [How to log on to a virtual machine running Windows Server][logon].\n\n2. After you log on to the virtual machine, open **Server Manager**. In the left pane, select **File and Storage Services**.\n\n    ![Open Server Manager](./media/storage-windows-attach-disk/fileandstorageservices.png)\n\n3. Expand the menu and select **Disks**.\n\n4. The **Disks** section lists disk 0, disk 1, and disk 2. Disk 0 is the operating system disk, disk 1 is the temporary disk (which should not be used for data storage), and disk 2 is the data disk you attached to the virtual machine. The data disk has a capacity of 5 GB, based on what you specified when you attached the disk. Right-click disk 2 and  select **Initialize**.\n\n5.  You're notified that all data will be erased when the disk is initialized. Click **Yes** to acknowledge the warning and initialize the disk.
