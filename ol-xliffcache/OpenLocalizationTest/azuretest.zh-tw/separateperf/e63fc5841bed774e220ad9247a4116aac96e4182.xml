A support package includes all the relevant logs in an encrypted, compressed format and is used to assist the Microsoft Support team with troubleshooting any StorSimple device issues.\n\nThis tutorial includes step-by-step instructions to create and manage the support package by using the:\n\n- **Support package** section of the **Maintenance** page in the StorSimple Manager service\n- Windows PowerShell for StorSimple\n\nAfter reading this tutorial, you will be able to:\n\n- Create a support package\n- Decrypt and edit a support package\n\n\n## Create a support package in the Management Portal\n\nTo troubleshoot any issues that you may be experiencing with StorSimple Manager service, you can create and upload a support package to the Microsoft Support site through the **Maintenance** page of the service in  the Management Portal. You will need to provide a support passkey to allow the upload. The support pass key should be provided to you by your Support Engineer in an email. An unencrypted, compressed support package is created (.cab file). This package can then be retrieved by the Support Engineer from the Support site when the engineer supplies the pass key.\n\nPerform the following steps in the Management Portal to create a support package:\n\n#### To create a support package in the Management Portal\n\n1. Navigate to **Devices > Maintenance**.\n\n2. In the **Support package** section, click **Create and upload support package**.\n\n3. In the **Create and upload support package** dialog box, do the following:\n\n    ![Create Support Package](./media/storsimple-create-manage-support-package/IC740923.png)\n                                            \n    - Provide the **Support Passkey**. This key should be sent to you by your Microsoft Support Engineer in an email.\n    \n    - Check the combo box to provide consent to **automatically upload the support package to the Microsoft Support site**.\n    \n    - Click the check icon ![Check icon](./media/storsimple-create-manage-support-package/IC740895.png).\n\n\n## Create a support package in Windows PowerShell for StorSimple\n\nIf you need to edit your log files prior to creating a package, you will need to create your package through the Windows PowerShell for StorSimple. \n\nPerform the following steps to create a support package in Windows PowerShell for StorSimple:\n\n\n#### To create a support package in Windows PowerShell for StorSimple\n\n1. Type the following command to start a Windows PowerShell session as an administrator on the remote computer used to connect to your StorSimple device:\n\n    `Start PowerShell`\n\n2. In the Windows PowerShell session, connect to the SSAdmin Console runspace of your device: \n\n\n    - At the command prompt, type: \n            \n        `$MS = New-PSSession -ComputerName <IP address for DATA 0> -Credential SSAdmin -ConfigurationName \"SSAdminConsole\"`\n        \n        \n    1. In the dialog box that opens, type your device administrator password. The default password is:\n     \n        `Password1`\n\n        ![PowerShell Session To SSAdminConsole Runspace](./media/storsimple-create-manage-support-package/IC740962.png)\n\n    2. Click **OK**.\n    1. At the command prompt, type: \n        \n        `Enter-PSSession $MS`\n\n\n3. In the session that opens, type the appropriate command. \n\n\n    - For network shares that are password protected, type:\n\n        `Export-HcsSupportPackage –PackageTag \"MySupportPackage\" –Credential \"Username\" -Force`\n\n        You will be prompted for a password, a path to the network shared folder, and an encryption passphrase (because the support package is encrypted). When these are provided, a support package will be created in the specified folder.\n                                            \n\n    - For open network shared folders (those that are not password protected), you do not need the `-Credential` parameter. Type the following: \n\n        `Export-HcsSupportPackage –PackageTag \"MySupportPackage\" -Force`\n\n        The support package will be created for both controllers in the specified network shared folder. It is an encrypted, compressed file that can be sent to Microsoft Support for troubleshooting. For more information, see [Contact Microsoft Support](storsimple-contact-microsoft-support.md).\n\n\n### More information about the Export-HcsSupportPackage cmdlet\nThe different parameters that can be used with the Export-HcsSupportPackage cmdlet are tabulated below.\n\n| S.

If you want to create a package only for the current controller, specify **Controller**. |\n\n\n## Edit a support package\n\nAfter you have generated a support package, you may need to edit the package to remove customer-specific information such as volume names, device IP addresses, and backup names from the log files. \n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] You can only edit a support package that was generated through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple. You cannot edit a package created in the Management Portal with StorSimple Manager service. \n\nTo edit a support package before uploading it on the Microsoft Support site, you will need to decrypt the support package, edit the files and then encrypt it again. Perform the following steps to edit a support package:\n\n#### To edit a support package in Windows PowerShell for StorSimple\n\n1. Generate a support package as described in [Create a support package in Windows PowerShell for StorSimple](#create-a-support-package-in-windows-powershell-for-storsimple).\n\n2. [Download the script](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Script-to-decrypt-a-a8d1ed65) locally on your client.\n\n3. Import the Windows PowerShell module. You will need to specify the path to the local folder in which you downloaded the script. To import the module, type:\n \n    `Import-module <Path to the folder that contains the Windows PowerShell script>`\n\n4. Open the support package folder. Note that all the files are *.aes* files that are compressed and encrypted. Open the files. To open files, type:\n\n    `Open-HcsSupportPackage <Path to the folder that contains support package files>`\n\n    This will decompress and decrypt the files. You will note that the actual file extensions are now displayed for all the files.\n    \n    ![Edit Support Package 3](./media/storsimple-create-manage-support-package/IC750706.png)\n\n\n5. When prompted for the encryption passphrase, type the passphrase used when the support package was created.\n\n        cmdlet Open-HcsSupportPackage at command pipeline position 1\n    \n        Supply values for the following parameters:EncryptionPassphrase: ****\n    \n6. Navigate to the folder that contains the log files. As the log files are now decompressed and decrypted, these will have original file extensions. Modify these files to remove any customer-specific information such as volume names and device IP addresses and save the files.\n\n7. Close the files. Closing the files will compress them with Gzip and then encrypt them with AES-256. This is for security and speed when transferring the support package over a network. To close files, type:\n\n    `Close-HcsSupportPackage <Path to the folder that contains support package files>`\n\n    ![Edit Support Package 2](./media/storsimple-create-manage-support-package/IC750707.png)\n\n8. When prompted, provide an encryption passphrase for the modified support package.\n\n        cmdlet Close-HcsSupportPackage at command pipeline position 1\n        Supply values for the following parameters:EncryptionPassphrase: ****\n\n9. Write down the new passphrase so that you can share it with Microsoft Support when requested.\n\n\n### Example: Editing files in a support package on a password-protected share\n\nAn example demonstrating how to decrypt, edit and re-encrypt a support package is shown below.\n\n![Edit Support Package1](./media/storsimple-create-manage-support-package/IC750708.png)\n\n        PS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> Import-module C:\\Users\\Default\\StorSimple\\SupportPackage\\HCSSupportPackageTools.psm1\n    \n        PS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> Open-HcsSupportPackage \\\\hcsfs\\Logs\\TD48\\TD48Logs\\C0-A\\etw\n    \n        cmdlet Open-HcsSupportPackage at command pipeline position 1\n    \n        Supply values for the following parameters:\n    \n        EncryptionPassphrase: ****\n    \n        PS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> Close-HcsSupportPackage \\\\hcsfs\\Logs\\TD48\\TD48Logs\\C0-A\\etw\n    \n        cmdlet Close-HcsSupportPackage at command pipeline position 1\n    \n        Supply values for the following parameters:\n    \n        EncryptionPassphrase: ****\n    \n        PS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32>\n\n## Next steps\n\nLearn how to [use support packages and device logs to troubleshoot your device deployment](storsimple-troubleshoot-deployment.md#support-packages-and-device-logs-available-for-troubleshooting). \n\n\n"
