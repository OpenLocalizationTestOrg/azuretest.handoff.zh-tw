ADO.NET attempts to connect to SQL Database.\n\n2. ADO.NET uses port 1433 to call a middleware module, and the middleware connects to SQL Database.\n\n3. SQL Database sends its response back to the middleware, which forwards the response to ADO.NET to port 1433.\n\n\n**Terminology:** We describe the preceding sequence by saying that ADO.NET interacts with SQL Database by using the *proxy route*. If no middleware were involved we would say the *direct route* was used.\n\n\n## V12 of SQL Database: Outside vs inside\n\n\nFor connections to V12 we must ask whether your client program runs *outside* or *inside* the Azure cloud boundary. The subsections discusses two common scenarios.\n\n\n#### *Outside:* Client runs on your desktop computer\n\n\nPort 1433 is the only port that must be open on your desktop computer that hosts your SQL Database client application.\n\n\n#### *Inside:* Client runs on Azure\n\n\nWhen your client runs inside the Azure cloud boundary, it uses what we can call a *direct route* to interact with the SQL Database server. After a connection is established, further interactions between the client and database involve no middleware proxy.\n\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n\n\n1. ADO.NET 4.5 (or later) initiates a brief interaction with the Azure cloud, and receives a dynamically identified port number.\n - The dynamically identified port number is in the range of 11000 - 11999.\n\n2. ADO.NET then connects to the SQL Database server directly, with no middleware in between.\n\n3. Queries are sent directly to the database, and results are returned directly to the client.\n\n\nEnsure that the port range of 11000 - 11999 on your Azure client machine is left available for ADO.NET 4.5 client interactions with SQL database V12.\n\n- In particular, ports in the range must be free of any other outbound blockers.\n- The Windows Firewall on your Azure VM controls the port settings.\n\n\n## Implicit retry logic contained in the proxy route\n\n\nIn a production environment, clients that connect to Azure SQL Database V11 or V12 are advised to implement retry logic in their code. This can be custom code, or can be code that leverages an API such as the Enterprise Library.\n\n\nThe proxy route discussed earlier in this topic is relevant to the question of retry logic:\n\n\n- In the V11, the middleware module that acted as a proxy also provided a modest degree of retry logic to gracefully handle some transient faults.\n\n- In the V12, the proxy does not provide any retry logic.\n\n\nIn both scenarios we advise that clients implement retry logic in their own code. Arguably the need for retry logic in the client is increased with the latest proxy route that provides no retry logic.\n\n\nFor code samples that demonstrate retry logic, see: \n[Client quick-start code samples to SQL Database](sql-database-develop-quick-start-client-code-samples.md).\n\n\n## Version clarifications\n\n\nThis section clarifies the monikers that refer to product versions. It also lists some pairings of versions between products.\n\n\n#### ADO.NET\n\n\n- ADO.NET 4.0 supports the TDS 7.3 protocol, but not 7.4.\n- ADO.NET 4.5 and later supports the TDS 7.4 protocol.\n\n\n#### SQL Database V11 and V12\n\n\nThe client connection differences between SQL Database V11 and V12 are highlighted in this topic.\n\n\n*Note:* The Transact-SQL statement `SELECT @@version;` returns a value that start with a number such as '11.' or '12.', and those match our version names of V11 and V12 for SQL Database.\n\n\n## Related links\n\n\n- [What's new in SQL Database V12](sql-database-v12-whats-new.md)\n\n\n- [Connecting to SQL Database: Links, Best Practices and Design Guidelines](sql-database-connect-central-recommendations.md)\n\n\n- ADO.NET 4.6 was released on July 20, 2015.
