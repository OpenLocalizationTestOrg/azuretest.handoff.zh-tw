This creates the infrastructure in which you can deploy and test a tiered, web-based LOB application.\n\n## Office 365 Directory Synchronization (DirSync) server in a hybrid cloud\n\nThe [Office 365 DirSync server in a hybrid cloud test environment](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-setup-dirsync-hybrid-cloud-testing.md) adds a DirSync server to the hybrid cloud base configuration and demonstrates Office 365 DirSync with password synchronization to a trial Office 365 subscription.\n\n## Simulated hybrid cloud test environment\n\nFor organizations and individuals for which a direct Internet connection and public IP address are not readily available, the [simulated hybrid cloud test environment](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-setup-simulated-hybrid-cloud-environment-testing.md) builds out the simplified on-premises network in a separate Azure Virtual Network and then connects the two virtual networks with a VNet-to-VNet VPN connection.\n\n\n## Additional resources\n\n[SharePoint farms hosted in Azure Infrastructure Services](virtual-machines-sharepoint-infrastructure-services.md)\n\n[PDF of the 3-D Line-of-Business Applications architecture blueprint](http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/C/8/2C8EB75F-AC45-4A79-8A63-C1800C098792/MS_Arch_LOB_App_3D_pdf.pdf)\n\n[Deploy Office 365 Directory Synchronization (DirSync) in Microsoft Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn635310.aspx)\n\n[Azure Infrastructure Services implementation guidelines](virtual-machines-infrastructure-services-implementation-guidelines.md)\n"
