Both topics are covered in this article. Higher service tiers like **Standard** and **Premium** modes offer greater robustness and flexibility in determining how your resources on Azure are used.\n\nChanging modes and configuring them is easily done in the Scale tab of the management portal. You can scale up or down as required. These changes take only seconds to apply and affect all web apps in your App Service plan. They do not require your code to be changed or your applications to be redeployed.\n\nFor information about App Service plans, see [What is an App Service Plan?](../web-sites-web-hosting-plan-overview.md) and [Azure App Service Plans In-Depth Overview](../app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview.md). For information the pricing and features of individual App Service plans, see [App Service Pricing Details](/pricing/details/web-sites/).  \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] Before switching a web app from the **Free** mode to **Basic**, **Standard**, or **Premium** mode, you must first remove the spending caps in place for your Azure App Service subscription. To view or change options for your Microsoft Azure App Service subscription, see [Microsoft Azure Subscriptions][azuresubscriptions].\n\n<a name=\"scalingsharedorbasic\"></a>\n<!-- ===================================== -->\n## Scaling to Shared or Basic mode\n<!-- ===================================== -->\n\n1. In your browser, open the [Azure Portal][portal].\n    \n2. In your web app's blade, click **All settings**, then click **Scale**, then click **Upgrade from a Free plan to add instances and get better performance**.\n    \n    ![Choose Plan][ChooseWHP]\n    \n4. In the **Choose your pricing tier** blade, choose either **Shared** or a **Basic** mode, then click **Select**.\n    \n    The **Notifications** tab will flash a green **SUCCESS** once the operation is complete. \n    \n5. Slide the **Instance** bar from left to right to increase the number of instances, then click **Save** in the command bar. The instance size option is not available in **Shared** mode. For more information about these instance sizes, see [Virtual Machine and Cloud Service Sizes for Microsoft Azure][vmsizes].\n    \n    ![Instance size for Basic mode][ChooseBasicInstances]\n    \n    The **Notifications** tab will flash a green **SUCCESS** once the operation is complete. \n    \n<a name=\"scalingstandard\"></a>\n<!-- ================================= -->\n## Scaling to Standard or Premium mode\n<!-- ================================= -->\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] Before switching an App Service plan to **Standard** or **Premium** mode, you should remove spending caps in place for your Microsoft Azure App Service subscription. Otherwise, you risk your web app becoming unavailable if you reach your caps before the billing period ends. To view or change options for your Microsoft Azure App Service subscription, see [Microsoft Azure Subscriptions][azuresubscriptions].\n\n1. To scale to **Standard** or **Premium** mode, follow the same initial steps as when scaling to **Shared** or **Basic**, and then choose a **Standard** or **Premium** mode in **Choose your pricing tier**, then click **Select**. \n    \n    The **Notifications** tab will flash a green **SUCCESS** once the operation is complete, and **Autoscale Mode** will be enabled.\n    \n    ![Scale in Standard or Premium Mode][ScaleStandard]\n    \n    You can still slide the **Instance** bar to manually scale to more instances, just like in **Basic** mode as shown above. However, here you will learn how to use **Autoscale Mode**. \n    \n2. In **Autoscale Mode**, select **Performance** to autoscale based on performance metrics.\n    \n    ![Autoscale Mode set to Performance][Autoscale]\n    \n3. In **Instance Range**, move the two sliders to define the minimum and maximum number of instances to scale automatically for the App Service plan. For this tutorial, move the maximum slider to **6** instances.\n    \n4. Click **Save** in the command bar.\n    \n4. Under **Target Metrics**, click **>** to configure autoscaling rules for the default metric.  \n    \n    ![Set Target Metrics][SetTargetMetrics]\n    \n    You can configure autoscaling rules for different performance metrics, including CPU, memory, disk queue, HTTP queue, and data flow. Here, you will configure autoscaling for CPU percentage that does the following:\n    \n    - Scale up by 1 instance if CPU is above 70% in the last 10 minutes\n    - Scale up by 3 instances if CPU is above 90% in the last 5 minutes\n    - Scale down by 1 instance if CPU is below 50% in the last 30 minutes \n    \n    \n4. Leave **Metric** dropdown as **CPU Percentage**.\n    \n5. In **Scale up rules**, configure the first rule by setting **Condition** to **Greater**, **Threshold** to **70** (%), **Over past** to **10** (minutes), **Scale up by** to **1** (instance), and **Cool down** to **10** (minutes). \n    \n    ![Set First Autoscale Rule][SetFirstRule]\n    \n    >[AZURE.NOTE] The **Cool down** setting specifies how long this rule should wait after the previous scale action to scale again.\n    \n6. Click **Add Scale Up Rule**, then configure the second rule by setting **Condition** to **Greater**, **Threshold** to **90** (%), **Over past** to **1** (minutes), **Scale up by** to **3** (instance), and **Cool down** to **1** (minutes).\n    \n    ![Set Second Autoscale Rule][SetSecondRule]\n    \n5. In **Scale down rules**, configure the third rule by setting **Condition** to **Less**, **Threshold** to **50** (%), **Over past** to **30** (minutes), **Scale down by** to **1** (instance), and **Cool down** to **60** (minutes). \n    \n    ![Set Third Autoscale Rule][SetThirdRule]\n    \n7. Click **Save** in the command bar. Your autoscale rule should now be reflected in the **Scale** blade. \n    \n    ![Set Autoscale Rule Result][SetRulesFinal]\n\n<a name=\"ScalingSQLServer\"></a>\n##Scaling a SQL Server Database connected to your web app\nIf you have one or more SQL Server databases linked to your web app (regardless of App Service plan mode), you can quickly scale them based on your needs.\n\n1. To scale one of the linked databases, open your web app's blade in the [Azure portal][portal]. In the **Essentials** collapsible dropdown, click the **Resource group** link. Then, in the **Summary** part of the resource group blade, clicked one of the linked databases.\n\n    ![Linked database][ResourceGroup]\n    \n2. In your linked SQL Database blade, click the **Pricing tier** part, select one of the tiers based on your performance requirement, and click **Select**. \n    \n    ![Scale your SQL Database][ScaleDatabase]\n    \n3. You can also set up geo-replication to increase the high availability and disaster recovery capabilities of your SQL Database.
