The DATA 0 interface is always configured through Windows PowerShell interface or the serial console, and is automatically cloud-enabled. DATA 0 interface is first configured through setup wizard during the initial deployment of the StorSimple device. When the device is in an operational mode, you may need to reconfigure DATA 0 settings. This tutorial provides two methods to modify DATA 0 network settings, both through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple.\n\nAfter reading this tutorial, you will be able to:\n\n- Modify DATA 0 network setting through the setup wizard\n- Modify DATA 0 network settings through `Set-HcsNetInterface` cmdlet\n\n\n## Modify DATA 0 network settings through setup wizard\nYou can reconfigure DATA 0 network settings by connecting to the Windows PowerShell interface of your StorSimple device and launching a setup wizard session. Perform the following steps to modify DATA 0 settings:\n\n#### To modify DATA 0 network settings through setup wizard\n\n1. In the serial console menu, choose option 1, **Log in with full access**. When prompted provide the **device administrator password**. The default password is `Password1`.\n\n2. At the command prompt, type:\n\n\n    `Invoke-HcsSetupWizard`\n\n3. A setup wizard will appear to help you configure the DATA 0 interface of your device. Provide new values for the IP address, gateway, and netmask.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The fixed controllers IPs will need to be reconfigured through the **Configure** page of the StorSimple device in the Azure Management Portal. For more information, go to [Modify network interfaces](storsimple-modify-device-config.md#modify-network-interfaces).\n\n\n## Modify DATA 0 network settings through Set-HcsNetInterface cmdlet\nAn alternate way to reconfigure DATA 0 network interface is through the use of  the `Set-HcsNetInterface` cmdlet. The cmdlet is executed from the Windows PowerShell interface of your StorSimple device. Perform the following steps to modify the DATA 0 settings: \n\n#### To modify DATA 0 network settings through the Set-HcsNetInterface cmdlet\n\n1. In the serial console menu, choose option 1, **Log in with full access**. When prompted provide the device administrator password. The default password is `Password1`.\n\n2. At the command prompt, type:\n\n    `Set-HCSNetInterface -InterfaceAlias Data0 -IPv4Address <> -IPv4Netmask <> -IPv4Gateway <> -Controller0IPv4Address <> -Controller1IPv4Address <> -IsiScsiEnabled 1 -IsCloudEnabled 1`\n    \n    In the angled brackets, type the following values for DATA 0:\n                                            \n    - IPv4 address\n    \n    - IPv4 gateway\n    \n    - IPv4 subnet mask\n    \n    - Fixed IPv4 address for Controller 0\n\n    - Fixed IPv4 address for Controller 1\n\n## Next steps\n\nTo configure network interfaces other than DATA 0, you can use the [Configure page in the Management Portal](storsimple-modify-device-config.md). If you experience any issues when configuring your network interfaces, refer to [Troubleshoot deployment issues](storsimple-troubleshoot-deployment.md).\n\n"
