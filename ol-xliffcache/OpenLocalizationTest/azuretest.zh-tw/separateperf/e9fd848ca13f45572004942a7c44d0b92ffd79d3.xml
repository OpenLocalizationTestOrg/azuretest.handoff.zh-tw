It describes common issues, possible causes, and recommended steps to help you resolve problems that you might experience when you run Microsoft Azure StorSimple. This information applies to both the StorSimple on-premises physical device and the StorSimple virtual device.\n\nAt the end of this article you can find a list of error codes that you might encounter during Microsoft Azure StorSimple operation, as well as steps you can take to resolve the errors. \n\n## Setup wizard process for operational devices\n\nYou use the setup wizard ([Invoke-HcsSetupWizard][1]) to check the device configuration and take corrective action if necessary.\n\nWhen you run the setup wizard on a previously configured and operational device, the process flow is different. You can change only the following entries:\n\n- IP address, subnet mask, and gateway\n- Primary DNS server\n- Primary NTP server\n- Optional web proxy configuration\n\nThe setup wizard does not perform the operations related to password collection and device registration.\n\n## Errors that occur during subsequent runs of the setup wizard\n\nThe following table describes the errors that you might encounter when you run the setup wizard on an operational device, possible causes for the errors, and recommended actions to resolve them. \n\n| No. | Error message or condition | Possible causes | Recommended action |\n|:--- |:-------------------------- |:--------------- |:------------------ |\n|  1  | Error 350032: This device has already been deactivated. | You will see this error if you run the setup wizard on a device that is deactivated. | [Contact Microsoft Support](storsimple-contact-microsoft-support.md) for next steps.
