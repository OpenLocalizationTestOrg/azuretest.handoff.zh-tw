Note that you can add more than one storage accounts to your Media Services account.\n\nWhen a new storage account is created, Azure generates two 512-bit storage access keys, which are used to authenticate access to your storage account. To keep your storage connections more secure, it is recommended to periodically regenerate and rotate your storage access key. Two access keys (primary and secondary) are provided in order to enable you to maintain connections to the storage account using one access key while you regenerate the other access key. This procedure is also called \"rolling access keys\".\n\nMedia Services has dependency on one of the storage keys (primary or secondary). Specifically, the locators that are used to stream or download your assets depend on the access key. When rolling storage access keys, you also need to make sure to update your locators so there will no interruption in your streaming service.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]After you regenerate a storage key, you must make sure to synchronize the update with Media Services. \n\nThis topic describes steps you would take to roll storage keys and update Media Services to use the appropriate storage key. Note, if you have multiple storage accounts, you would perform this procedure with each storage account.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]Before executing steps described in this topic on a production account, make sure to test them on a pre-production account.\n\n\n## Step 1: Regenerate secondary storage access key\n\nStart with regenerating secondary storage key. By default, the secondary key is not used by Media Services.  For information on how to roll storage keys, see [How to: View, copy, and regenerate storage access keys](../storage-create-storage-account.md#view-copy-and-regenerate-storage-access-keys).\n  \n##<a id=\"step2\"></a>Step 2:  Update Media Services to use the new secondary storage key\n\nUpdate Media Services to use the secondary storage access key. You can use one of the following two methods to synchronize the regenerated storage key with Media Services.\n\n- Use Azure Portal: select your Media Service account, and click on the “MANAGE KEYS” icon on the bottom of the portal window. Depending on which storage key you want for the Media Services to synchronize with, select the synchronize primary key or synchronize secondary key button. In this case, use the secondary key.\n\n- Use Media Services management REST API. \n\n    The following code example shows how to construct the https://endpoint/<subscriptionId>/services/mediaservices/Accounts/<accountName>/StorageAccounts/<storageAccountName>/Key request in order to synchronize the specified storage key with Media Services. In this case, the secondary storage key value is used. For more information, see [How to: Use Media Services Management REST API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn167656.aspx).\n \n        public void UpdateMediaServicesWithStorageAccountKey(string mediaServicesAccount, string storageAccountName, string storageAccountKey)\n        {\n            var clientCert = GetCertificate(CertThumbprint);\n        \n            HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(string.Format(\"{0}/{1}/services/mediaservices/Accounts/{2}/StorageAccounts/{3}/Key\",\n                Endpoint, SubscriptionId, mediaServicesAccount, storageAccountName));\n            request.Method = \"PUT\";\n            request.ContentType = \"application/json; charset=utf-8\";\n            request.Headers.Add(\"x-ms-version\", \"2011-10-01\");\n            request.Headers.Add(\"Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\");\n            request.ClientCertificates.Add(clientCert);\n        \n        \n            using (var streamWriter = new StreamWriter(request.GetRequestStream()))\n            {\n                streamWriter.Write(\"\\\"\");\n                streamWriter.Write(storageAccountKey);\n                streamWriter.Write(\"\\\"\");\n                streamWriter.Flush();\n            }\n        \n            using (var response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse())\n            {\n                string jsonResponse;\n                Stream receiveStream = response.GetResponseStream();\n                Encoding encode = Encoding.GetEncoding(\"utf-8\");\n                if (receiveStream != null)\n                {\n                    var readStream = new StreamReader(receiveStream, encode);\n                    jsonResponse = readStream.ReadToEnd();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nAfter this update existing locators (that have dependency on the old storage key).\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]Wait for 30 minutes before performing any operations with Media Services (for example, creating new locators) in order to prevent any impact on pending jobs.\n\n##Step 3: Update locators \n\nAfter 30 minutes you can update existing locators so they take dependency on the new secondary storage key.  \n\nTo update expiration date on a locator, use [REST](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974308.aspx#update_a_locator ) or [.NET](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533259) APIs. Note that when you update the expiration date of a SAS locator, the URL changes. \n\n##Step 5: Regenerate  primary storage access key\n\nRegenerate the primary storage access key.
