It will be invoked inside a function and must return `false` when you do not want the Logic app to run, and can return anything else when you want the Logic app to run. You will be able to use the content of the response in the actions of the Logic app.\n- **Context object** - An optional object that can be passed into the trigger. You can define as many properties as you want, but the top-level entity must be an object, e.g. `{ \"bar\" : 0}`.\n\nFor example, you could have a simple trigger that will only run your Logic app between the :15 and :30 of the hour:\n\n```\nvar d = new Date(); return (d.getMinutes() > 15) && (d.getMinutes() < 30);\n```\n\n###Action\n\nLikewise, you can provide an action to run. \n\nThe inputs to the action are:\n- **JavaScript expression**  - An expression that will be evaluated. You must include the `return` statement to get any content. \n- **Context object** - An optional object that can be passed into the trigger. You can define as many properties as you want, but the top-level entity must be an object, e.g. `{ \"bar\" : 0}`.\n\nFor example, imagine you are using the Office 365 trigger **New Email**. That returns the following object:\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"Attachments\" : [\n        {\n            \"name\" : \"Picture.png\",\n            \"content\" : {\n                \"ContentData\" : \"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFAQMAAAC3obSmAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAGUExURf///wAAAFXC034AAAASSURBVAjXY2BgCGBgYOhgKAAABEIBSWDJEbYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\",\n                \"ContentType\" : \"image/png\",\n                \"ContentTransferEncoding\" : \"Base64\"\n            }\n        },  \n        {\n            \"name\" : \"File.txt\",\n            \"content\" : {\n                \"ContentData\" : \"Don't worry, be happy!\",\n                \"ContentType\" : \"text/plain\",\n                \"ContentTransferEncoding\" : \"None\"\n            }\n        }   \n    ]\n}\n```\n\nBut, you want to upload these attachments to a Yammer post. Unfortunately, the schema for Yammer attachments is slightly different. Now, you can now parse this inside your Logic app. For the context object just pass: `@triggerBody()`, and for the expression, pass:\n\n```\nreturn Attachments.map(function(obj){var a = obj.Content; a.FileName = obj.Name; return a;})\n```\n\nThe action returns the JSON that you returned from your function. Thus, in the Yammer API app you can reference `@body('javascriptapi')` for the **Attachments** property.\n\n## Do more with your Connector\nNow that the connector is created, you can add it to a business flow using a Logic App. See [What are Logic Apps?](app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md).\n\nYou can also review performance statistics and control security to the connector. See [Manage  and Monitor API apps and connector](../app-service-api/app-service-api-manage-in-portal.md).\n\n<!--References -->\n\n<!--Links -->\n[Creating a Logic App]: app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md\n\ntest\n"
