Azure Load Balancer can be configured to use a 2 tuple (Source IP, Destination IP) or 3 tuple (Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol) to map traffic to the available servers. By using Source IP affinity, connections initiated from the same client computer goes to the same DIP endpoint.\n\n![hash based load balancer](./media/load-balancer-distribution-mode/load-balancer-session-affinity.png)\n\nSource IP affinity solves an incompatibility between the Azure Load Balancer and RD Gateway. Now you can build a RD gateway farm in a single cloud service.\nAnother usage scenario is media upload where the real data upload happens through UDP but wherein the control plane is achieved through TCP:\n\n- A client first initiates a TCP session to the load balanced public address, gets directed to a specific DIP, this channel is left active to monitor the connection health\n- A new UDP session from the same client computer is initiated to the same load balanced public endpoint, the expectation here is that this connection is also directed to the same DIP endpoint as the previous TCP connection so that media upload can be executed at high throughput while also maintaining a control channel through TCP.\n \nNote that if the load-balanced set changes (removing or adding a virtual machine), the distribution of client requests is recomputed. You cannot depend on new connections from existing client sessions ending up at the same server. Additionally, using source IP affinity distribution mode may cause an unequal distribution of traffic. Clients running behind proxies may be seen as one unique client application.\n\nThe distribution algorithm used is a 5 tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol type) hash to map traffic to available servers. It provides stickiness only within a transport session. Packets in the same TCP or UDP session will be directed to the same datacenter IP (DIP) instance behind the load balanced endpoint. When the client closes and re-opens the connection or starts a new session from the same source IP, the source port changes and causes the traffic to go to a different DIP endpoint.\n\n![hash based load balancer](./media/load-balancer-distribution-mode/load-balancer-distribution.png)\n\n\n## Configuring Source IP affinity settings for load balancer\n \nFor virtual machines, you can use powershell to change timeout settings:\n \nAdd an Azure endpoint to a Virtual Machine and set load balancer distribution mode\n\n    Get-AzureVM -ServiceName \"mySvc\" -Name \"MyVM1\" | Add-AzureEndpoint -Name \"HttpIn\" -Protocol \"tcp\" -PublicPort 80 -LocalPort 8080 –LoadBalancerDistribution “sourceIP”| Update-AzureVM\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] LoadBalancerDistribution can be set to sourceIP for 2-tuple (source IP, Destination IP) load balancing, sourceIPProtocol for 3-tuple (source IP, DestinaDestination IP, protocol) load balancing or none if you want the default behavior of 5-tuple load balancing\n\n\nRetrieve an endpoint load balancer distribution mode configuration\n\n    PS C:\\> Get-AzureVM –ServiceName “MyService” –Name “MyVM” | Get-AzureEndpoint\n\n    VERBOSE: 6:43:50 PM - Completed Operation: Get Deployment\n    LBSetName : MyLoadBalancedSet\n    LocalPort : 80\n    Name : HTTP\n    Port : 80\n    Protocol : tcp\n    Vip : 65.52.xxx.xxx\n    ProbePath :\n    ProbePort : 80\n    ProbeProtocol : tcp\n    ProbeIntervalInSeconds : 15\n    ProbeTimeoutInSeconds : 31\n    EnableDirectServerReturn : False\n    Acl : {}\n    InternalLoadBalancerName :\n    IdleTimeoutInMinutes : 15\n    LoadBalancerDistribution : sourceIP\n \nIf the LoadBalancerDistribution element is not present then the Azure Load balancer uses the default 5-tuple algorithm.\n\n \n### Set the Distribution mode on a load balanced endpoint set\n\nIf endpoints are part of a load balanced endpoint set, the distribution mode must be set on the load balanced endpoint set:\n\n    Set-AzureLoadBalancedEndpoint -ServiceName \"MyService\" -LBSetName \"LBSet1\" -Protocol tcp -LocalPort 80 -ProbeProtocolTCP -ProbePort 8080 –LoadBalancerDistribution \"sourceIP\"\n\n### Cloud Service configuration to change distribution mode\n\nYou can leverage the Azure SDK for .NET 2.5 (to be released in November) to update your Cloud Service\nEndpoint settings for Cloud Services are made in the .csdef.
