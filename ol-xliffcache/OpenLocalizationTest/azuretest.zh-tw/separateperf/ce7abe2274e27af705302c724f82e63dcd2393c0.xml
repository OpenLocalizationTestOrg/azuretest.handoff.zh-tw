After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.  \n\nThis tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:\n\n1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]\n2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]\n3. [Add authentication to the app]\n\nThis tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].\n\nCompleting this tutorial requires [Xamarin.iOS], XCode 6.0 and iOS 7.0 or later versions.\n\n##<a name=\"register\"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)]\n\n##<a name=\"permissions\"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users\n\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-javascript-backend](../../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-javascript-backend.md)]\n\n\n3. In Xcode, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].\n\n4. Press the **Run** button to build the project and start the app in the iPhone emulator; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.\n\n    This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the _TodoItem_ table now requires authentication.\n\nNext, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.\n\n##<a name=\"add-authentication\"></a>Add authentication to the app\n\n1. Open the **ToDoService** project file and add the following variables\n\n        // Mobile Service logged in user\n        private MobileServiceUser user;\n        public MobileServiceUser User { get { return user; } }\n\n2. Then add a new method named **Authenticate** to **ToDoService** defined as:\n\n        private async Task Authenticate(MonoTouch.UIKit.UIViewController view)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                user = await client.LoginAsync(view, MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.MicrosoftAccount);\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                Console.Error.WriteLine (@\"ERROR - AUTHENTICATION FAILED {0}\", ex.Message);\n            }\n        }\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] If you are using an identity provider other than a Microsoft Account, change the value passed to **LoginAsync** above to one of the following: _Facebook_, _Twitter_, _Google_, or _WindowsAzureActiveDirectory_.\n\n3. Move the request for the **ToDoItem** table from the **ToDoService** constructor into a new method named **CreateTable**:\n\n        private async Task CreateTable()\n        {\n            // Create an MSTable instance to allow us to work with the ToDoItem table\n            todoTable = client.GetSyncTable<ToDoItem>();\n        }\n\n4. Create a new asynchronous public method named **LoginAndGetData** defined as:\n\n        public async Task LoginAndGetData(MonoTouch.UIKit.UIViewController view)\n        {\n            await Authenticate(view);\n            await CreateTable();\n        }\n\n5. In the **TodoListViewController** override the **ViewDidAppear** method and define it as found below. This logs in the user if the **ToDoService** doesn't yet have a handle on the user:\n\n        public override async void ViewDidAppear(bool animated)\n        {\n            base.ViewDidAppear(animated);\n\n            if (QSToDoService.DefaultService.User == null)\n            {\n                await QSToDoService.DefaultService.LoginAndGetData(this);\n            }\n\n            if (QSToDoService.DefaultService.User == null)\n            {\n                // TODO:: show error\n                return;\n            }\n\n            RefreshAsync();\n        }\n6. Remove the original call to **RefreshAsync** from **TodoListViewController.ViewDidLoad**.\n\n7. Press the **Run** button to build the project, start the app in the iPhone emulator, then log-on with your chosen identity provider.\n\n    When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.\n\n## Get completed example\nDownload the [completed example project]. Be sure to update the **applicationURL** and **applicationKey** variables with your own Azure settings.\n\n## <a name=\"next-steps\"></a>Next steps\n\nIn the next tutorial, [Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.\n\n<!-- Anchors. -->\n[Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]: #register\n[Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]: #permissions\n[Add authentication to the app]: #add-authentication\n[Next Steps]:#next-steps\n\n<!-- Images. -->\n[4]: ./media/partner-xamarin-mobile-services-ios-get-started-users/mobile-services-selection.png\n[5]: ./media/partner-xamarin-mobile-services-ios-get-started-users/mobile-service-uri.png\n[13]: ./media/partner-xamarin-mobile-services-ios-get-started-users/mobile-identity-tab.png\n[14]: ./media/partner-xamarin-mobile-services-ios-get-started-users/mobile-portal-data-tables.png\n[15]: ./media/partner-xamarin-mobile-services-ios-get-started-users/mobile-portal-change-table-perms.png\n\n<!-- URLs.
