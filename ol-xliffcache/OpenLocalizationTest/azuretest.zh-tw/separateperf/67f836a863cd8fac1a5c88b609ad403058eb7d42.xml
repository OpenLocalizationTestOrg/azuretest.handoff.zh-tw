You can create one quickly with the instructions in [Getting Started with Microsoft Azure SQL Database](sql-database-get-started.md). The examples here are based on the AdventureWorks sample database you create in that article, but the same steps, up until you perform the query, apply to any SQL database.\n\n## Install and start SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)\nWhen working with SQL Database, you should use the most recent version of SSMS. See [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx) to get it. With the most recent version, SSMS automatically notifies you when the most recent update is available.\n\n## Start SSMS and connect to your SQL database server\n1. Type \"Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio\" in the Windows search box, and then click the desktop app to start SSMS.\n2. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, in the **Server name** box, type the name of the server that hosts your SQL database in the format *&lt;servername>*.**database.windows.net**.\n3. Choose **SQL Server Authentication** from the **Authentication** list.\n4. Type the **Login** and **Password** you set up when you created the server, and then click **Connect**.\n\n    ![SSMS Connect to Azure SQL Database server](./media/sql-database-connect-query-ssms/1-connect.png)\n\n### If the connection fails\nThe most common reason for connection failures are mistakes in the server name, user name, or password, as well as the server not allowing connections for security reasons. Make sure that the firewall settings of the server allow connections from your local computer's IP address and the IP address that the SSMS client uses. Sometimes they're different. \n\nIf the connection fails because of a firewall rule, the IP address is reported in the error message. Add this IP address to the server firewall rule. For more information, see [How to: Configure Firewall Settings (Azure SQL Database)](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings.md).\n\n## Run sample queries\nAfter you connect, you can run a sample query. If you didn't create the database using the AdventureWorks sample in [Getting Started with Microsoft Azure SQL Database](sql-database-get-started.md), this query won't work. Skip straight to Next Steps to learn more.\n\n1. In **Object Explorer**, navigate to the **AdventureWorks** database.\n2. Right-click the database and then select **New Query**.\n\n    ![New query](./media/sql-database-connect-query-ssms/4-run-query.png)\n\n3. In the query window, copy and paste the following code.\n\n        SELECT\n        CustomerId\n        ,Title\n        ,FirstName\n        ,LastName\n        ,CompanyName\n        FROM SalesLT.Customer;\n\n4. Click the **Execute** button.  The following screen shot shows a successful query.\n\n    ![Sucess](./media/sql-database-connect-query-ssms/5-success.png)\n\n## Next steps\nYou can use Transact-SQL statements to create and manage databases in Azure in much the same way you can with SQL Server. If you're familiar with using Transact-SQL with SQL Server, see [Azure SQL Database Transact-SQL information)](sql-database-transact-sql-information.md) for a summary of differences.\n\nIf you're new to Transact-SQL, see [Tutorial: Writing Transact-SQL Statements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms365303.aspx) and the [Transact-SQL Reference (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb510741.aspx)."
