If you have installed a previous version of Service Fabric on your PC, please follow the [instructions to update your development environment ](service-fabric-update-your-development-environment.md).\n\n## Prerequisites\n### Supported Operating System versions\nThe following operating system versions are supported:\n\n- Windows 8/8.1\n- Windows Server 2012 R2\n- Windows 10\n\n### Visual Studio 2015\n\nThe tools for Service Fabric depend on Visual Studio 2015, which you can find [here][2].\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] If you aren't running one of the supported OS versions or would prefer not to install Visual Studio 2015 on your PC, you can set up an Azure virtual machine with Windows Server 2012 R2 and Visual Studio 2015 pre-installed using an image from the VM Gallery.\n\n## Install the runtime, SDK, and tools\n\nInstallation of the Service Fabric components is done by the Web Platform Installer. Follow these instructions to install:\n\n1. [Download the SDK][3] using the Web Platform Installer.\n\n2. Click **Install** to begin the install process.\n\n3. Review and accept the EULA.\n\nInstallation will proceed automatically.\n\n## Enable PowerShell script execution\n\nService Fabric uses Windows PowerShell scripts for creating a local development cluster and for deploying applications from Visual Studio. By default, Windows will block these scripts from running. To enable them, you must modify your PowerShell execution policy. Open PowerShell as an administrator and enter the following command:\n\n    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force -Scope CurrentUser\n\n\n## Install and start a local cluster\nA local cluster represents the multi-machine topology that you will eventually use in production on a single development machine. To set up the local cluster, follow these steps:\n\n\n1. Close all other PowerShell windows and start a new one as an administrator.\n\n2. Navigate to the cluster setup directory with `cd \"$env:ProgramW6432\\Microsoft SDKs\\Service Fabric\\ClusterSetup\"`\n\n3. Run `.\\DevClusterSetup.ps1`\n\nIn a few moments you should see output that shows node information and confirmation that the cluster was created successfully. In some cases, you may see warnings while the Service Fabric Host Service and Naming Services start up. These are normal and will be followed momentarily by some basic information about the cluster.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] Your local cluster uses exactly the same runtime as what will run in Azure. It is not simulated or emulated in any way. The only difference is that all of your nodes run on a single machine, rather than being distributed across multiple machines as they will be in Azure.\n\n## Validate your cluster setup\n\nYou can check that your cluster was created successfully using the Service Fabric Explorer tool that ships with the SDK.\n\n1. Start the Service Fabric Explorer by running `. \"$env:ProgramW6432\\Microsoft SDKs\\Service Fabric\\Tools\\ServiceFabricExplorer\\ServiceFabricExplorer.exe\"`.\n\n2. Expand the Onebox/Local Cluster node in the top-left corner.\n\n3. Ensure that the Application and Node views are green.\n\nIf any element is not green or you see an error, wait a few moments and click the refresh button. If you still have issues, check out the [setup troubleshooting steps](service-fabric-troubleshoot-local-cluster-setup.md).\n\n## Next steps\nNow that your development environment is set up, you can start building and running apps.\n\n- [Learn about the programming models: Reliable Actors and Reliable Services](service-fabric-choose-framework.md)\n- [Get started with the Reliable Services API](service-fabric-reliable-services-quick-start.md)\n- [Get started with the Reliable Actors API](service-fabric-reliable-actors-get-started.md)\n- [Check out the Service Fabric samples on GitHub](https://github.com/azure/servicefabric-samples)\n- [Visualize your cluster using Service Fabric Explorer](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md)\n\n[1]: http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/campaigns/service-fabric/ \"Service Fabric campaign page\"\n[2]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517106 \"VS RC\"\n[3]:http://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx?command=getinstallerredirect&appid=MicrosoftAzure-ServiceFabric \"WebPI link\"\n"
