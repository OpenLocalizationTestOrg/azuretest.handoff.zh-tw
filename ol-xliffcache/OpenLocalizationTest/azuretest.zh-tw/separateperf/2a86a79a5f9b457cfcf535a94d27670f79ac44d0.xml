Create a file named **composer.json** in the root of your project and add the following code to it:\n\n        {\n            \"repositories\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"pear\",\n                    \"url\": \"http://pear.php.net\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"require\": {\n                \"pear-pear.php.net/mail_mime\" : \"*\",\n                \"pear-pear.php.net/http_request2\" : \"*\",\n                \"pear-pear.php.net/mail_mimedecode\" : \"*\",\n                \"microsoft/windowsazure\": \"*\"\n            }\n        }\n\n\n3. Download **[composer.phar][composer-phar]** in your project root.\n\n4. Open a command prompt and execute the following command in your project root\n\n        php composer.phar install\n\n### Install manually\n\nTo download and install the PHP Client Libraries for Azure manually, follow these steps:\n\n1. Download a .zip archive that contains the libraries from [GitHub][php-sdk-github]. Alternatively, fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. The latter option requires a GitHub account and having Git installed locally.\n\n    \n    > [AZURE.NOTE] The PHP Client Libraries for Azure have a dependency on the [HTTP_Request2](http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2), [Mail_mime](http://pear.php.net/package/Mail_mime), and [Mail_mimeDecode](http://pear.php.net/package/Mail_mimeDecode) PEAR packages. The recommended way to resolve these dependencies is to install these packages using the [PEAR package manager](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php).\n\n\n2. Copy the `WindowsAzure` directory of the downloaded archive to your application directory structure.\n\nFor more information about installing the PHP Client Libraries for Azure (including information about installing as a PEAR package), see [Download the Azure SDK for PHP][download-SDK-PHP].\n\n\n[php-sdk-github]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252719\n[install-git]: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\n[download-SDK-PHP]: ../articles/php-download-sdk.md\n[composer-phar]: http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar\n"
