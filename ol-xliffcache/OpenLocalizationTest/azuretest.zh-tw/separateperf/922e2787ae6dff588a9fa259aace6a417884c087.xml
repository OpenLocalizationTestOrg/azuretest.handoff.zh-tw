A device can have multiple volume containers for all its volumes. \n\nA volume container has the following attributes:\n\n- **Volumes** – The thinly provisioned StorSimple volumes that are contained within the volume container. A volume container may contain up to 256 thinly provisioned StorSimple volumes.\n\n- **Encryption** – An encryption key that can be defined for each volume container. This key is used for encrypting the data that is sent from your StorSimple device to the cloud. A military-grade AES-256 bit key is used with the user-entered key. To secure your data, we recommend that you always enable cloud storage encryption.\n\n- **Storage account** – The storage account that is linked to your cloud storage service provider. All the volumes residing in a volume container share this storage account. You can choose a storage account from an existing list, or create a new account when you create the volume container and then specify the access credentials for that account.\n\n- **Cloud bandwidth** – The bandwidth consumed by the device when the data from the device is being sent to the cloud. You can enforce a bandwidth control by specifying a value between 1 and 1000 Mbps when you define this container. If you want the device to consume all available bandwidth, set this field to Unlimited. You can also create and apply a bandwidth template to allocate bandwidth based on schedule.\n\n![Volume containers page](./media/storsimple-manage-volume-containers/HCS_VolumeContainersPage.png)\n\nThis following procedures explain how to use the StorSimple **Volume containers** page to complete the following common operations:\n\n- Add a volume container \n- Modify a volume container \n- Delete a volume container \n\n## Add a volume container\n\nPerform the following steps to create a volume container.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-add-volume-container](../../includes/storsimple-add-volume-container.md)]\n\n\n## Modify a volume container\n\nPerform the following steps to modify a volume container.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-modify-volume-container](../../includes/storsimple-modify-volume-container.md)]\n\n\n## Delete a volume container\n\nA volume container has volumes within it.
