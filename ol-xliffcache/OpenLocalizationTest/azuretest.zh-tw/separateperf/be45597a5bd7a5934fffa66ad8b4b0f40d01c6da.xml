For example, the “Friends Feed” (sometimes referred as the \"follower\" problem) allows users to view status updates from people they are connected to, similar to how Facebook and Twitter work.\nThe Actor model provides flexibility to approach the materialization problem. We can populate the Friends Feed at event time, updating the Friends Feed of all my friends at the moment an update is posted, as illustrated below:\n\n![][2]\n\n\n## Smart Cache code sample – Social Network Friends Feed (event time)\n\nSample code populating Friends Feed:\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ISocialPerson : IActor\n{\n    Task AddFriend(long person);\n    Task RemoveFriend(long person);\n    Task<List<SocialStatus>> GetFriendsFeed();\n    Task<SocialStatus> GetStatus();\n    Task<List<SocialStatus>> GetMyFeed();\n    Task UpdateStatus(string status);\n    Task UpdateFriendFeedAsync(SocialStatus status);\n}\n\n[DataContract]\nPublic class SocialPersonState\n{\n    [DataMember]\n    public string _name; // my name\n    [DataMember]\n    public List<long> _friends; // list of my friends' IDs\n    [DataMember]\n    public List<SocialStatus> _friendsFeed; // my friends feeds\n    [DataMember]\n    public List<SocialStatus> _myFeed; // this is my feed, all my status updates\n    [DataMember]\n    public SocialStatus _lastStatus; // this is my last update\n}\n\npublic class SocialPerson : Actor, ISocialPerson\n{\n    public override Task ActivateAsync()\n    {\n        CreateOrRestoreState();\n        return base.ActivateAsync();\n    }\n\n    public Task AddFriend(long person)\n    {\n        State._friends.Add(person);\n        return TaskDone.Done;\n    }\n\n    public Task RemoveFriend(long person)\n    {\n        State._friends.Remove(person);\n        return TaskDone.Done;\n    }\n\n    public Task<List<SocialStatus>> GetFriendsFeed()\n    {\n        return Task.FromResult(State._friendsFeed);\n    }\n\n    public Task UpdateStatus(string status)\n    {\n        State._lastStatus = new SocialStatus()\n        {\n            Name = _name,\n            Status = status,\n            Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow\n        };\n        State._myFeed.Add(_lastStatus);\n\n        var taskList = new List<Task>();\n\n        foreach(var friendId in _friends)\n        {\n            var friend = ActorProxy.Create<ISocialPerson>(friendId);\n            taskList.Add(friend.UpdateFriendFeedAsync(_lastStatus));\n        }\n\n        return Task.WhenAll(taskList);\n    }\n\n    public Task UpdateFriendFeed(SocialStatus status)\n    {\n        State._friendsFeed.Add(status);\n\n        return TaskDone.Done;\n    }\n\n    public Task<SocialStatus> GetStatus()\n    {\n        return Task.FromResult(State._lastStatus);\n    }\n\n    public Task<List<SocialStatus>> GetMyFeed()\n    {\n        return Task.FromResult(State._myFeed);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively we can model our Actors to fan out and compile the Friends Feed at the query timer, in other words when the user asks for their friends feed. Another method we can use is materializing the Friends Feed on a timer, for example, every 5 minutes. Or, we can optimize the model and combine both event time and query time processing with a timer-based model depending on user habits, such as how often they login or post an update.\nWhen modelling an actor in a social network, one should also consider “super users,” users with millions of followers. Developers should model the state and behaviour of such users differently to meet the demand.\nSimilarly, if we want to model an activity that connects many user actors to a single activity actor (hub and spoke) that can be done as well. Group chat or game hosting scenarios are two examples.\nLet’s take the group chat example; a set of participants create a group chat actor that can distribute messages from one participant to the group as in the example below:\n\n## Smart Cache code sample – GroupChat\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IGroupChat : IActor\n{\n    Task PublishMessageAsync(long participantId, string message);\n    Task<List<GroupChatMessage>> GetMessagesAsync();\n    Task AddParticipantAsync(long participantId);\n    Task RemoveParticipantAsync(long partitipantId);\n}\n\n[DataContract]\npublic class GroupChatParticipantState\n{\n    [DataMember]\n    Public long _groupChatId;\n    [DataMember]\n    public List<GroupChatMessage> _messages;\n}\n\npublic class GroupChatParticipant : Actor<GroupChatParticipantState>, IGroupParticipant\n{\n    public Task SendMessageAsync(string message)\n    {\n        if (State._groupChatId != -1)\n        {\n            var groupChat = ActorProxy.Create<IGroupChat>(State._groupChatId);\n            return groupChat.PublishMessageAsync(this.Id, message);\n        }\n\n        return TaskDone.Done;\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n\n[DataContract]\npublic class GroupChatState\n{\n    [DataMember]\n    Public List<long> _participants;\n    [DataMember]\n    Public List<GroupChatMessage> _messages;\n}\n\n\npublic class GroupChat : Actor<GroupChatState>, IGroupChat\n{\n\npublic Task PublishMessageAsync(long participantId, string message)\n{\n    var chatMessage = new GroupChatMessage()\n    {\n        ParticipantId = participantId,\n        Message = message,\n        Timestamp = DateTime.Now\n    };\n\n    State._messages.Add(chatMessage);\n\n    var taskList = new List<Task>();\n\n    foreach(var id in State._participants)\n    {\n        if (id != participantId)\n        {\n            var participant = ActorProxy.Create<IGroupParticipant>.Create(id);\n            taskList.Add(participant.ReceiveMessageAsync(chatMessage));\n        }\n    }\n    return Task.WhenAll(taskList);\n}\n\n...\n\n}\n```\n\nAll it really does is leverage Reliable Actors' ability to allow any actor to address any other actor in the cluster by id and communicate with it without needing to worry about placement, addressing, caching, messaging, serialization, or routing.\n\n## Next Steps\n[Pattern: Smart Cache](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-smart-cache.md)\n\n[Pattern: Resource Governance](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-resource-governance.md)\n\n[Pattern: Stateful Service Composition](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-stateful-service-composition.md)\n\n[Pattern: Internet of Things](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-internet-of-things.md)\n\n[Pattern: Distributed Computation](service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-distributed-computation.md)\n\n[Some Anti-patterns](service-fabric-reliable-actors-anti-patterns.md)\n\n[Introduction to Service Fabric Actors](service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction.md)\n\n\n<!--Image references-->\n[1]: ./media/service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-distributed-networks-and-graphs/distributedNetworks_arch1.png\n[2]: ./media/service-fabric-reliable-actors-pattern-distributed-networks-and-graphs/distributedNetworks_arch2.png\n"
