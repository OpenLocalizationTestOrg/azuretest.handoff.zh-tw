Support for SSRS in SharePoint mode will be added in a later release.\n\n### Opening data assets in Excel\n\nWhen opening data assets in Microsoft Excel from the Azure Data Catalog portal, users may be prompted with a **Microsoft Excel Security Notice** dialog box. This is standard, expected behavior, and users can select **Enable** to continue.\n\nFor more information, see [Enable or disable security alerts about links and files from suspicious websites](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-or-disable-security-alerts-about-links-and-files-from-suspicious-websites-A1AC6AE9-5C4A-4EB3-B3F8-143336039BBE).\n\n### BLOB and UDT columns missing in previews\n\nWhen registering tables and views that contain binary large object (BLOB) and user-defined data type (UDT) columns, and selecting to include preview for the data assets, these columns will not be included in the preview.\n\n### Proxy and policy configuration and data source registration\n\nUsers may encounter a situation where they can log on to the Azure Data Catalog portal, but when they attempt to log on to the data source registration tool they encounter an error message that prevents them from logging on.\n\nThere are two potential causes for this problem behavior:\n\n**Cause 1: Active Directory Federation Services Configuration**\nThe data source registration tool uses Forms Authentication to validate user logons against Active Directory. For successful logon, Forms Authentication must be enabled in the Global Authentication Policy by an Active Directory administrator.\n\nIn some situations, this error behavior may occur only when the user is on the company network, or only when the user is connecting from outside the company network. The Global Authentication Policy allows authentication methods to be enabled separately for intranet and extranet connections. Logon errors may occur if Forms Authentication is not enabled for the network from which the user is connecting.\n\nFor more information, see [Configuring intranet forms-based authentication for devices that do not support WIA](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn727110.aspx).\n\n**Cause 2: Network Proxy Configuration**\nIf the corporate network uses a proxy server, the registration tool may not be able to connect to Azure Active Directory through the proxy. Users can ensure that the registration tool by editing the toolâ€™s configuration file, adding this section to the file:\n\n\n      <system.net>\n        <defaultProxy useDefaultCredentials=\"true\" enabled=\"true\">\n          <proxy usesystemdefault=\"True\"\n                          proxyaddress=\"http://<your corporate network proxy url>\"\n                          bypassonlocal=\"True\"/>\n        </defaultProxy>\n      </system.net>\n\n\nTo locate the RegistrationTool.exe.config file, launch the registration tool, and then open the Windows Task Manager utility. On the Details tab in Task manager, right-click on RegistrationTool.exe and choose Open file location from the pop-up menu.\n\ntest\n"
