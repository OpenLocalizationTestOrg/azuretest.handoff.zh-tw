To find out how [click here](service-fabric-reliable-services-quick-start.md).\n\n## Installing the NuGet package\nReleased as part of the Service Fabric SDK is a prerelease version of our nuget package Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Telemetry.ApplicationInsights. \nThis package ties together the Service Fabric EventSource events with Application Insights to give you automated instrumentation of your Service Fabric app.\nThis package will be continue to be updated with new events which will be automatically emitted by your application.\n\nYou can install the package with the following steps:\n\n1. Open the NuGet Package Manager for your Service Fabric app.  This can be done by right-clicking your project in Visual Studio and selecting 'Manage NuGet Packages...'.\n2. You will need to select 'Microsoft Azure Service Fabric' as your package source to list packages included in the Service Fabric SDK. \n![VS2015 NuGet Package Manager](media/service-fabric-diagnostics-application-insights-setup/AI-nuget-package-manager.jpg)\n3. Select the Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Telemetry.ApplicationInsights package on the left.\n4. Click Install to begin the install process.\n5. Review and accept the EULA.\n\n## Enabling Service Fabric events\nIn order to receive Service Fabric events automatically in Application Insights you will need to enable our listener.\nYou can do this by inserting the following line of code into your app.\n\n```csharp\n    Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Telemetry.ApplicationInsights.Listener.Enable(EventLevel.Verbose);\n```\n \n### Example for StatefulActor\\Program.cs:\n\n```csharp\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Telemetry.ApplicationInsights.Listener.Enable(EventLevel.Verbose);\n        try\n        {\n            using (FabricRuntime fabricRuntime = FabricRuntime.Create())\n            {\n                fabricRuntime.RegisterActor(typeof(StatefulActor));\n\n                Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);\n            }\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            ActorEventSource.Current.ActorHostInitializationFailed(e);\n            throw;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nYou can learn about the events emitted from the Reliable Actors runtime [here](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md) and Reliable Services runtime [here](service-fabric-reliable-services-diagnostics.md).\n\nNote that in order to get Reliable Actors runtime method calls, EventLevel.Verbose must be used (as shown in examples above).\n\n## Setting up Application Insights\nAn instrumentation key is what ties your Service Fabric app to your Application Insights resource.  You can learn how to get your instrumentation key by following [Application Insight's guide](../app-insights-create-new-resource.md#create-an-application-insights-resource).\nSelect 'Other' for application type when creating resources.\n\n![Select Other for AI app type](media/service-fabric-diagnostics-application-insights-setup/AI-app-type-other.JPG)\n\nOnce you have your instrumentation key, you can insert it into the ApplicationInsights.config file like so:\n\n```xml\n    <InstrumentationKey>INSERT YOUR KEY HERE</InstrumentationKey>\n```\n\n## Viewing data\nYou can [customize the App Insights blade](../app-insights-metrics-explorer.md) to fit your needs. \nMost Service Fabric events will show up as 'Custom Events', while Fabric Actor method calls and service RunAsync() calls will show up as requests.  \nModeling these events as requests allows you to use the 'request name' dimension and 'request duration' metric when building charts.\nNew charts, metrics, and events will continue to be added which you will be able to leverage in the future.\n\n## Next steps\nLearn more about using Application Insights to instrument your Service Fabric apps.\n\n- [Getting started with Application Insights](../app-insights-get-started.md)\n- [Learn to create your own custom events and metrics](../app-insights-custom-events-metrics-api.md)\n \n"
