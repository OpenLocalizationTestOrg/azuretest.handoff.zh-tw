Read more about DocumentDB server-side programming [here](documentdb-programming.md).\n\nBy completing this tutorial, you'll be able to answer the following questions:  \n\n-   How can I easily view DocumentDB stored procedures via a web browser?\n-   How can I easily view DocumentDB triggers via a web browser?\n-   How can I easily view DocumentDB user-defined functions via a web browser?\n\n## Launch and navigate Script Explorer\n\nScript Explorer can be launched from any of the DocumentDB account, database, and collection blades.  \n\n1. At the top of the DocumentDB account or database blade, simply click the **Script Explorer** command.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the Script Explorer command](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorercommand.png)\n \n2. Alternatively, near the bottom of each blade is a **Developer Tools** lens that contains the **Script Explorer** part.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the Script Explorer part](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerpart.png)\n\n2. Simply click the command or the part to launch Script Explorer.\n\n    <p>The **Database** and **Collection** drop-down list boxes are pre-populated depending on the context in which you launch Script Explorer.  For example, if you launch from a database blade, then the current database is pre-populated.  If you launch from a collection blade, then the current collection is pre-populated.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerinitial.png)\n\n\n3. The **Database** and **Collection** drop-down list boxes can be used to easily change the collection from which scripts are currently being viewed without having to close and re-launch Script Explorer.  \n\n4. Script Explorer also supports filtering the currently loaded set of scripts by their id property.  Simply type in the filter box.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer with filter highlighted](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerfilter.png)\n\n    And the results in the Script Explorer list are filtered based on your supplied criteria.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer with filtered results](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerfilterresults.png)\n\n\n    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] The Script Explorer filter functionality only filters from the ***currently*** loaded set of scripts and does not automatically refresh the currently selected collection.\n\n5. To refresh the list of scripts loaded by Script Explorer, simply click the **Refresh** command at the top of the blade.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer refresh command](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerrefresh.png)\n\n\n## View, edit, create, and delete stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions with  Script Explorer\n\nScript Explorer allows you to easily perform CRUD operations on DocumentDB server-side programming artifacts.  \n\n- To create a script, simply click on the applicable create command within script explorer, provide an id, enter the contents of the script, and click  the **Save** command.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer create option](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorercreatecommand.png)\n\n- When creating a trigger, you must also specify the trigger type and trigger operation\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer create trigger option](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorercreatetrigger.png)\n\n- To view a script, simply click the script in which you're interested.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer view script experience](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerviewscript.png)\n\n- To edit a script, simply make the desired changes and click the **Save** command.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer view script experience](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorereditscript.png)\n\n- To discard any pending changes to a script, simply click the **Discard** command.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer discard changes experience](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerdiscardchanges.png)\n\n- Script Explorer also allows you to easily view the system properties of the currently loaded script by clicking the **Properties** command.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer script properties view](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptproperties.png)\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] The timestamp (_ts) property is internally represented as epoch time, but Script Explorer displays the value in a human readable GMT format.\n\n- To delete a script, select it in Script Explorer and click the **Delete** command.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer delete command](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerdeletescript1.png)\n\n- Confirm the delete action by clicking **Yes** or cancel the delete action by clicking **No**.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Script Explorer delete command](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerdeletescript2.png)\n\n## Next steps\n\nTo learn more about DocumentDB, click [here](http://azure.com/docdb).\n \n\ntest\n"
