In this tutorial, you will modify the Mobile Services quickstart project to use MongoDB instead of the default Azure SQL Database data store.\n\nThe tutorial requires completion of the [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Add Mobile Services to an existing app] tutorial. You will also need to add the MongoLab service to your subscription. \n\n## <a name=\"create-store\"></a>Create the MongoLab non-relational store\n\n1. In the [Azure Management Portal], click **New** and click **Marketplace**.\n\n2. Click the **MongoLab** add-on, and complete the wizard to sign up for a MongoLab account. \n\n    For more information about MongoLab, see the [MongoLab Add-on Page].\n\n2. Once the account is set up, click **Connection Info** and copy the connection string.\n\n3. In your mobile service, click the **Configure** tab, scroll down to **Connection strings** and enter a new connection string with a **Name** of `MongoConnectionString` and a **Value** that is your MongoDB connection, then click **Save**. \n\n    ![Add the MongoDB connection string](./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-use-non-relational-data-store/mongo-connection-string.png)\n\n    The storage account connection string is stored encrypted in app settings. You can access this string in any table controller at runtime. \n\n8. In Solution Explorer in Visual Studio, open the Web.config file for the mobile service project and add the following new connection string:\n\n        <add name=\"MongoConnectionString\" connectionString=\"<MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>\" />\n\n9. Replace the `<MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>` placeholder with the MongoDB connection string.\n\n    The mobile service uses this connection string when it runs on your local computer, which lets you test the code before you publish it. When running in Azure, the mobile service instead uses the connection string value set in the portal and ignores the connection string in the project.  \n\n## <a name=\"modify-service\"></a>Modify data types and table controllers\n\n1.

In **TodoItemController**, replace the **Initialize** method with the following:\n\n        protected override async void Initialize(HttpControllerContext controllerContext)\n        {\n            base.Initialize(controllerContext);\n            string connectionStringName = \"MongoConnectionString\";\n            string databaseName = \"<YOUR-DATABASE-NAME>\";\n            string collectionName = \"todoItems\";\n            DomainManager = new MongoDomainManager<TodoItem>(connectionStringName, databaseName, \n                collectionName, Request, Services);\n        }\n\n4. In the code for the **Initialize** method above, replace `<YOUR-DATABASE-NAME>` with the name you chose when you provisioned the MongoLab add-on.\n\nYou are now ready to test the app.\n\n## <a name=\"test-application\"></a>Test the application\n\n1.
