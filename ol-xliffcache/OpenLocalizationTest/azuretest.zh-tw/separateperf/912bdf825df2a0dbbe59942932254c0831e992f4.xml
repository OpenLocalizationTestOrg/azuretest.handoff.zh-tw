After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.\n\nThis tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:\n\n1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]\n2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]\n3. [Add authentication to the app]\n\nThis tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].\n\n##<a name=\"register\"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)]\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension.md)]\n\n##<a name=\"permissions\"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)]\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><p>In Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio, run the client project on a device or simulator. Verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.</p>\n\n    <p>This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the <em>TodoItem</em> table now requires authentication.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\nNext, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.\n\n##<a name=\"add-authentication\"></a>Add authentication to the app\n\n1. Add the following property to the **TodoActivity** class:\n\n            private MobileServiceUser user;\n\n2. Add the following method to the **TodoActivity** class:\n\n            private async Task Authenticate()\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    user = await client.LoginAsync(this, MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook);\n                    CreateAndShowDialog(string.Format(\"you are now logged in - {0}\", user.UserId), \"Logged in!\");\n                }\n                catch (Exception ex)\n                {\n                    CreateAndShowDialog(ex, \"Authentication failed\");\n                }\n            }\n\n    This creates a new method to handle the authentication process. The user is authenticated by using a Facebook login. A dialog is displayed which displays the ID of the authenticated user.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] If you are using an identity provider other than a Facebook, change the value passed to **LoginAsync** above to one of the following: _MicrosoftAccount_, _Twitter_, _Google_, or _WindowsAzureActiveDirectory_.\n\n3. In the **OnCreate** method, add the following line of code after the code that instantiates the `MobileServiceClient` object.\n\n        // Get the Mobile Service Table instance to use\n        toDoTable = client.GetTable <ToDoItem> ();\n\n        await Authenticate(); // add this line\n\n    This call starts the authentication process and awaits it asynchronously.\n\n\n4. From the **Run** menu, then click **Run** to start the app and sign in with your chosen identity provider.\n\n    When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.\n\n\n<!-- ## <a name=\"next-steps\"> </a>Next steps\n\nIn the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users][Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.\n -->\n\n<!-- Anchors. -->\n[Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]: #register\n[Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]: #permissions\n[Add authentication to the app]: #add-authentication\n[Next Steps]:#next-steps\n\n\n<!-- URLs. -->\n[Submit an app page]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=266582\n[My Applications]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=262039\n[Live SDK for Windows]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=262253\n[Get started with Mobile Services]: mobile-services-dotnet-backend-xamarin-android-get-started.md\n[Get started with authentication]: mobile-services-dotnet-backend-xamarin-android-get-started-users.md\n[Get started with push notifications]: mobile-services-dotnet-backend-xamarin-android-get-started-push.md\n[Authorize users with scripts]: ../mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-authorize-users-in-scripts.md\n[JavaScript and HTML]: ../mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started-users.md\n\n[Azure Management Portal]: https://manage.windowsazure.com/\n\ntest\n"
