In the **Resource Group** box, enter the same name as your app.\n\n4. The Default App Service plan will be selected.  If you wish to change your App Service plan, you can do so by clicking on the App Service Plan > **+ Create New**.  Provide a name of the new App Service plan and select an appropriate location.  Click the Pricing tier and select an appropriate pricing tier for the service. Select **View all** to view more pricing options, such as **Free** and **Shared**.  Once you have selected the pricing tier, click the **Select** button.  Back in the **App Service plan** blade, click **OK**.\n\n5. Click **Create**. This creates a Mobile App backend where you will later deploy your server project.  Provisioning a Mobile App backend can take a couple of minutes.  Once the Mobile App backend is provisioned, the portal will open the **Settings** blade for the Mobile App backend.
