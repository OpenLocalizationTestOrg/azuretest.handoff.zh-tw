You can also retrieve phone numbers and usage data. Logic apps can trigger based on a variety of data sources and offer connectors to get and process data as a part of the flow. You can add the Twilio Connector to your business workflow and process data as part of this workflow within a Logic App. \n\n## Creating an Twilio connector for your Logic App ##\nA connector can be created within a logic app or be created directly from the Azure Marketplace. To create a connector from the Marketplace:  \n\n1. In the Azure startboard, select **Marketplace**.\n2. Search for “Twilio Connector”, select it, and select **Create**.\n3. Configure the Twilio connector as follows:  \n![][1]  \n    - **Location** - choose the geographic location where you would like the connector to be deployed\n    - **Subscription** - choose a subscription you want this connector to be created in\n    - **Resource group** - select or create a resource group where the connector should reside\n    - **Web hosting plan** - select or create a web hosting plan\n    - **Pricing tier** - choose a pricing tier for the connector\n    - **Name** - give a name for your Twilio Connector\n    - **Package settings**\n        - **Account SID** - The unique identifier of the account.

Create a new Logic App and choose the same resource group which has the Twilio Connector:  \n![][2]\n2.  Open “Triggers and Actions” to open the Logic Apps Designer and configure your flow:  \n![][3]\n3.

You can drop the Twilio Connector API app into the editor by clicking on the “Twilio Connector”.\n\n5.  You can now use Twilio connector in the flow. You can use the \"Send Message\" action in the flow to send a message. Configure the input properties for \"Send Message\" action as follows:\n    - **From Phone Number** - Enter a Twilio phone number enabled for the type of message you wish to send. Only phone numbers or short codes purchased from Twilio will work with this connector.\n    - **To Phone Number** - The destination phone number. The format accepted is: +, followed by the country code, then the phone number. For example, +16175551212.
