Logic apps can trigger based on a variety of data sources and offer connectors to get and process data. You can add the Dropbox connector to your business workflow and process data as part of this workflow within a Logic App.\n\n## Triggers and Actions\n\nA Trigger starts a new instance based on a specific event, like the arrival of a new message. An Action is the result, like after receiving a new message, then upload the file to Dropbox.\n\nThe Dropbox connector can be used as an action in a logic app and supports data in JSON and XML formats. The Dropbox connector has the following Triggers and Actions available:\n\nTriggers | Actions\n--- | ---\nNone | <ul><li>Delete File</li><li>Get File</li><li>Upload File</li><li>List Files</li></ul>\n\n\n## Create an Dropbox connector for your Logic App\nA connector can be created within a logic app or be created directly from the Azure Marketplace. To create a connector from the Marketplace:  \n\n1. In the Azure startboard, select **Marketplace**.\n2. Search for “Dropbox Connector”, select it, and select **Create**.\n3. Enter the Name, App Service Plan, and other properties:  \n    ![][1]\n    - **Location** - choose the geographic location where you would like the connector to be deployed\n    - **Subscription** - choose a subscription you want this connector to be created in\n    - **Resource group** - select or create a resource group where the connector should reside\n    - **App Service plan** - select or create a web hosting plan\n    - **Pricing tier** - choose a pricing tier for the connector\n    - **Name** - give a name for your Dropbox Connector  \n4. Select **Create**.\n\n\n## Using the Dropbox Connector in your Logic App\nOnce your API app is created, you can now use the Dropbox connector as an action for your Logic App. To do this:\n\n1.  In your logic app, open **Triggers and Actions** to open the Logic Apps Designer and configure your flow:  \n    ![][3]\n2.  The Dropbox connector is listed in the gallery:  \n    ![][4]\n3.  Select the Dropbox connector to automatically add in the designer. Select **Authorize**, enter your credentials, and select **Allow**:  \n    ![][5]\n    ![][6]\n    ![][7]\n\nYou can now use Dropbox connector in the flow. You can use the Dropbox action \"upload File\" to upload a file to your Dropbox account:  \n    ![][8]\n    ![][9]\n\nConfigure the input properties for \"Upload File\" action as follows:  \n\n- **File Path** - Specify the destination Dropbox file path of the file to be uploaded. Example: Photos/image.png\n- **Content** - Specifies the content of the file to be uploaded. Often, this will come from a previous step in your Logic App.\n- **Content Transfer Encoding** - Specify none or base64.\n- **Overwrite** - Specify \"true\" to overwrite the file if it already exists.\n\n## Do more with your Connector\nNow that the connector is created, you can add it to a business workflow using a Logic App. See [What are Logic Apps?](app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md).\n\nView the Swagger REST API reference at [Connectors and API Apps Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=529766).\n\nYou can also review performance statistics and control security to the connector. See [Manage and Monitor your built-in API Apps and Connectors](app-service-logic-monitor-your-connectors.md).\n\n<!-- Image reference -->\n[1]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img1.PNG\n[2]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img2.PNG\n[3]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img3.png\n[4]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img4.png\n[5]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img5.PNG\n[6]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img6.PNG\n[7]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img7.PNG\n[8]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img8.PNG\n[9]: ./media/app-service-logic-connector-dropbox/img9.PNG\n\ntest\n"
