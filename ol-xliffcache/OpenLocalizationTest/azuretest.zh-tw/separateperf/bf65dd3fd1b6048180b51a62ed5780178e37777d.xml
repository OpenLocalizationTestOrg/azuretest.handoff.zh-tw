You can then configure the virtual machine with additional software, or use the virtual machine for diagnostic or debugging purposes.\n\nTo create a virtual machine when you create a website, follow these steps:\n\n1. In Visual Studio, click **File** > **New** > **Project** > **Web**, and then choose **ASP.NET Web Application** (under the **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** nodes).\n2. In the **New ASP.NET Project** dialog box, select the type of web application you want, and in the Azure section of the dialog box (in the lower-right corner), make sure that the **Host in the cloud** check box is selected (this check box is labeled **Create remote resources** in some installations).\n\n    ![][0]\n\n3. In the drop-down list under Microsoft Azure, choose **Virtual Machine**, and then click the **OK** button.\n4. Sign in to Azure if you're prompted. The **Create Virtual Machine** dialog box appears.\n\n    ![][2]\n\n5. In the **DNS name** box, enter a name for the virtual machine. The DNS name must be unique in Azure. If the name you entered isn't available, a red exclamation point appears.\n6. In the **Image** list, choose the image you want to base the virtual machine on. You can choose any of the standard Azure virtual machine images or your image that you've uploaded to Azure.\n7. Leave the **Enable IIS and Web Deploy** check box selected unless you plan to install a different web server. You won't be able to publish from Visual Studio if you disable Web Deploy. You can add IIS and Web Deploy to any of the packaged Windows Server images, including your own custom images.\n8. In the **Size** list, choose the size of the virtual machine.\n9. Specify the sign-in credentials for this virtual machine. Make a note of them, because you'll need them to access the machine through Remote Desktop.\n10. In the **Location** list, choose the region to host the virtual machine.\n11. Click  the **OK** button to start creating the virtual machine. You can follow the progress of the operation in the **Output** window.\n\n    ![][3]\n\n12. When the virtual machine is provisioned, published scripts are created in a **PublishScripts** node in your solution. The published script runs and provisions a virtual machine in Azure. The **Output** window shows the status. The script performs the following actions to set up the virtual machine:\n\n    * Creates the virtual machine if it doesn't already exist.\n    * Creates a storage account with a name that begins with `devtest`, but only if there isn't already such a storage account in the specified region.\n    * Creates a cloud service as a container for the virtual machine, and creates a web role for the website.\n    * Configures Web Deploy on the virtual machine.\n    * Configures IIS and ASP.NET on the virtual machine.\n\n    ![][4]\n\n<br/>\n13. (Optional) You can connect to the new virtual machine. In **Server Explorer**, expand the **Virtual Machines** node, choose the node for the virtual machine you created, and on its shortcut menu, choose **Connect with Remote Desktop**.\n\n ![][5]\n\n\n## Next steps\n\nIf you want to customize the published scripts you created, read more in-depth information at [Using Windows PowerShell Scripts to Publish to Dev and Test Environments](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn642480.aspx).\n\n[0]: ./media/virtual-machines-dotnet-create-visual-studio-powershell/CreateVM_NewProject.PNG\n[1]: ./media/dotnet-visual-studio-create-virtual-machine/CreateVM_SignIn.PNG\n[2]: ./media/virtual-machines-dotnet-create-visual-studio-powershell/CreateVM_CreateVM.PNG\n[3]: ./media/virtual-machines-dotnet-create-visual-studio-powershell/CreateVM_Provisioning.png\n[4]: ./media/virtual-machines-dotnet-create-visual-studio-powershell/CreateVM_SolutionExplorer.png\n[5]: ./media/virtual-machines-dotnet-create-visual-studio-powershell/VS_Create_VM_Connect.png\n"
