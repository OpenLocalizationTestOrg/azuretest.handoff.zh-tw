The start and stop operations will be visible in the jobâ€™s operation logs. To avoid this behavior, scale the query out across multiple partitions. In a future release, this limitation will be addressed by degrading performance on impacted jobs instead of restarting them.\nLarge blob inputs without payload timestamp may cause Out-of-memory issue|Consuming large files from Blob storage may cause Stream Analytics jobs to crash if a timestamp field is not specified via TIMESTAMP BY. To avoid this issue, keep each blob under 10MB in size.\nSQL Database event volume limitation|When using SQL Database as an output target, very high volumes of output data may cause the Stream Analytics job to time out. To resolve this issue, either reduce the output volume by using aggregates or filter operators, or choose Azure Blob storage or Event Hubs as an output target instead.\nPowerBI datasets can only contain one table|PowerBI does not support more than one table in a given dataset.\n\n## Get help\nFor further assistance, try our [Azure Stream Analytics forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=AzureStreamAnalytics)\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [Introduction to Azure Stream Analytics](stream-analytics-introduction.md)\n- [Get started using Azure Stream Analytics](../stream.analytics.get.started.md)\n- [Scale Azure Stream Analytics jobs](stream-analytics-scale-jobs.md)\n- [Azure Stream Analytics Query Language Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn834998.aspx)\n- [Azure Stream Analytics Management REST API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835031.aspx)\n \n"
