In Visual Studio Application Insights, you can easily see how long your application waits for dependencies and how often a dependency call fails.\n\n## Where you can use it\n\nOut of the box dependency monitoring is currently available for:\n\n* ASP.NET web apps and services running on an IIS server or on Azure\n* [Java web apps](app-insights-java-agent.md)\n\nFor other types, such as device apps, you can write your own monitor using the [TrackDependency API](app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md#track-dependency).\n\nThe out-of-the-box dependency monitor currently reports calls to these  types of dependencies:\n\n* ASP.NET\n * SQL databases\n * ASP.NET web and WCF services that use HTTP-based bindings\n * Local or remote HTTP calls\n * Azure DocumentDb, table, blob storage, and queue\n* Java\n * Calls to a database through a [JDBC](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/) driver, such as MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL or SQLite.\n\nAgain, you could write your own SDK calls to monitor other dependencies.\n\n## To set up dependency monitoring\n\nInstall the appropriate agent for the host server.\n\nPlatform | Install\n---|---\nIIS Server | [Status Monitor](app-insights-monitor-performance-live-website-now.md)\nAzure Web App | [Application Insights Extension](../insights-perf-analytics.md)\nJava web server | [Java web apps](app-insights-java-agent.md)\n\nThe Status Monitor for IIS Servers doesn't need you to rebuild your source project with the Application Insights SDK. \n\n## <a name=\"diagnosis\"></a> Diagnosing dependency performance issues\n\nTo assess the performance of requests at your server:\n\n![In the Overview page of your application in Application Insights, click the Performance tile](./media/app-insights-dependencies/01-performance.png)\n\nScroll down to look at the grid of requests:\n\n![List of requests with averages and counts](./media/app-insights-dependencies/02-reqs.png)\n\nThe top one is taking very long.
