Providing what's known as *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)*, virtual machine technology can be used in variety of ways. Some examples are:\n\n- **Virtual machines (VMs) for development and test.** Development groups commonly use VMs because they offer a quick, easy way to create a computer with specific configurations required to code and test an application. Azure Virtual Machines provides a straightforward and economical way to create these VMs, use them, then delete them when they're no longer needed.\n- **Running applications in the cloud.** It makes economic sense to run some applications in the public cloud. One example is an application that has large spikes in demand. Although you could equip your own data center with enough hardware to handle peak demand, that hardware might be underutilized much of the time.

Or, suppose you're a start-up that needs on-demand computing resources quickly and with no commitment. Once again, Azure can be the right choice.\n- **Extending your own datacenter into the public cloud.** When you use Azure Virtual Network, your organization can create a virtual network (VNET) that's an extension of your own on-premises network and add VMs to that VNET. This allows running applications such as [SharePoint](virtual-machines-sharepoint-infrastructure-services.md), [SQL Server](virtual-machines-sql-server-infrastructure-services.md) and others on an Azure VM.

You can use an image provided by Azure or one of it's partners, or use your own. Examples include various versions, editions and configurations of:\n \n-   Windows Server \n-   Linux servers such as Suse, Ubuntu and CentOS\n-   SQL Server\n-   BizTalk Server \n-   SharePoint Server\n\nVirtual machines use virtual hard disks (VHDs) to store their operating system (OS) and data.
