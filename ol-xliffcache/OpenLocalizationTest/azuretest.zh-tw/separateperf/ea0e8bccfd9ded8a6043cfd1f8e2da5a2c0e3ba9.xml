This value must be greater than 64 and a power of 2.|\n\n## Store Configuration\nStore Configurations are used to configure the local store that is used to persist the state that is being replicated.\nThe default configuration is generated by the Visual Studio template and should suffice. This section talks about additional configurations that are available to tune the local store.\n### Section Name\n&lt;ActorName&gt;ServiceLocalStoreConfig\n### Configuration Names\n\n|Name|Unit|Default Value|Remarks|\n|----|----|-------------|-------|\n|MaxAsyncCommitDelay|Milliseconds|200|Sets the maximum batching interval for durable local store commits.|\n|MaxVerPages|Number of pages|8192|The maximum number of version pages in the local store database. It determines the maximum number of outstanding transactions.|\n\n## Sample Configuration File\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<Settings xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric\">\n   <Section Name=\"MyActorServiceReplicatorConfig\">\n      <Parameter Name=\"ReplicatorEndpoint\" Value=\"MyActorServiceReplicatorEndpoint\" />\n      <Parameter Name=\"BatchAcknowledgementInterval\" Value=\"0.05\"/>\n   </Section>\n   <Section Name=\"MyActorServiceLocalStoreConfig\">\n      <Parameter Name=\"MaxVerPages\" Value=\"8192\" />\n   </Section>\n   <Section Name=\"MyActorServiceReplicatorSecurityConfig\">\n      <Parameter Name=\"CredentialType\" Value=\"X509\" />\n      <Parameter Name=\"FindType\" Value=\"FindByThumbprint\" />\n      <Parameter Name=\"FindValue\" Value=\"9d c9 06 b1 69 dc 4f af fd 16 97 ac 78 1e 80 67 90 74 9d 2f\" />\n      <Parameter Name=\"StoreLocation\" Value=\"LocalMachine\" />\n      <Parameter Name=\"StoreName\" Value=\"My\" />\n      <Parameter Name=\"ProtectionLevel\" Value=\"EncryptAndSign\" />\n      <Parameter Name=\"AllowedCommonNames\" Value=\"My-Test-SAN1-Alice,My-Test-SAN1-Bob\" />\n   </Section>\n</Settings>\n```\n## Remarks\n\nBatchAcknowledgementInterval controls replication latency. A value of '0' results in the lowest possible latency, at the cost of throughput (as more acknowledgement messages must be sent and processed, each containing fewer acknowledgements).\nThe larger the value for BatchAcknowledgementInterval, the higher the overall replication throughput, at the cost of higher operation latency. This directly translates to the latency of transaction commits.\n \n"
