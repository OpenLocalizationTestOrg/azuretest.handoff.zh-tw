When using queues, components of a distributed application do not communicate directly with each other; instead they exchange messages via a queue, which acts as an intermediary (broker). A message producer (sender) hands off a message to the queue and then continues its processing. Asynchronously, a message consumer (receiver) pulls the message from the queue and processes it. The producer does not have to wait for a reply from the consumer in order to continue to process and send further messages. Queues offer **First In, First Out (FIFO)** message delivery to one or more competing consumers. That is, messages are typically received and processed by the receivers in the order in which they were\nadded to the queue, and each message is received and processed by only one message consumer.\n\n![QueueConcepts](./media/howto-service-bus-queues/sb-queues-08.png)\n\nService Bus queues are a general-purpose technology that can be used for a wide variety of scenarios:\n\n-   Communication between web and worker roles in a multi-tier Azure application.\n-   Communication between on-premises apps and Azure hosted apps in a hybrid solution.\n-   Communication between components of a distributed application running on-premises in different organizations or departments of an organization.\n\nUsing queues enables you to scale out your applications more easily, and enable more resiliency to your architecture.\n\n## Create a service namespace\n\nTo begin using Service Bus queues in Azure, you must first create a service namespace. A namespace provides a scoping container for addressing Service Bus resources within your application.\n\nTo create a service namespace:\n\n1.  Log on to the [Azure Management Portal][].\n\n2.  In the left navigation pane of the Management Portal, click **Service Bus**.\n\n3.  In the lower pane of the Management Portal, click **Create**.\n    ![](./media/howto-service-bus-queues/sb-queues-03.png)\n\n4.  In the **Add a new namespace** dialog, enter a namespace name. The system immediately checks to see if the name is available.   \n    ![](./media/howto-service-bus-queues/sb-queues-04.png)\n\n5.  After making sure the namespace name is available, choose the country or region in which your namespace should be hosted (make sure you use the same country/region in which you are deploying your compute resources).\n\n    IMPORTANT: Pick the **same region** that you intend to choose for deploying your application. This will give you the best performance.\n\n6.  Leave the other fields in the dialog with their default values (**Messaging** and **Standard Tier**), then click the check mark. The system now creates your namespace and enables it. You might have to wait several minutes as the system provisions resources for your account.\n\n    ![](./media/howto-service-bus-queues/getting-started-multi-tier-27.png)\n\nThe namespace you created takes a moment to activate, and will then appear in the management portal. Wait until the namespace status is **Active** before continuing.\n\n## Obtain the default management credentials for the namespace\n\nIn order to perform management operations, such as creating a queue on the new namespace, you must obtain the management credentials for the namespace. You can obtain these credentials from either the Azure management portal, or from the Visual Studio Server Explorer.\n\n###To obtain management credentials from the portal\n\n1.  In the left navigation pane, click the **Service Bus** node, to display the list of available namespaces:   \n    ![](./media/howto-service-bus-queues/sb-queues-13.png)\n\n2.  Select the namespace you just created from the list shown:   \n    ![](./media/howto-service-bus-queues/sb-queues-09.png)\n\n3.  Click **Connection Information**.   \n    ![](./media/howto-service-bus-queues/sb-queues-06.png)\n\n4.  In the **Access connection information** pane, find the connection string that contains the SAS key and key name.   \n\n    ![](./media/howto-service-bus-queues/multi-web-45.png)\n    \n5.  Make a note of the key, or copy it to the clipboard.\n\n### To obtain management credentials from Server Explorer\n\nTo obtain connection information using Visual Studio instead of the management portal, follow the procedure described [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff687127.aspx), in the section titled **To connect to Azure from Visual Studio**. When you sign in to Azure, the **Service Bus** node under the **Azure** tree in Server Explorer is automatically populated with any namespaces you've already created. Right-click any namespace, and then click **Properties** to see the connection string and other metadata associated with this namespace displayed in the Visual Studio **Properties** pane. \n\nMake a note of the **SharedAccessKey** value, or copy it to the clipboard:\n\n![][34]\n\n  [Azure Management Portal]: http://manage.windowsazure.com\n  [Azure Management Portal]: http://manage.windowsazure.com\n\n  [34]: ./media/howto-service-bus-queues/VSProperties.png\n"
