The scenarios covered include querying for data, inserting, updating, and deleting data, authenticating users, and handling errors. If you are new to Mobile Services, you should consider first completing the [Mobile Services quickstart](mobile-services-html-get-started.md). The quickstart tutorial helps you configure your account and create your first mobile service.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-concepts](../../includes/mobile-services-concepts.md)]\n\n##<a name=\"create-client\"></a>How to: Create the Mobile Services client\n\nThe way that you add a reference to the Mobile Services client depends on your app platform, which includes the following:\n\n- For a web-based application, open the HTML file and add the following to the script references for the page:\n\n        <script src=\"http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/mobileservices/MobileServices.Web-1.2.5.min.js\"></script>\n\n- For a Windows Store app written in JavaScript/HTML, add the **WindowsAzure.MobileServices.WinJS** NuGet package to your project. \n\n- For a PhoneGap or Cordova app, add the [Mobile Services plugin](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-services-cordova) to your project. This plugin supports [push notifications](#push-notifications).\n\nIn the editor, open or create a JavaScript file, and add the following code that defines the `MobileServiceClient` variable, and supply the application URL and application key from the mobile service in the `MobileServiceClient` constructor, in that order.\n\n    var MobileServiceClient = WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient;\n    var client = new MobileServiceClient('AppUrl', 'AppKey');\n\nYou must replace the placeholder `AppUrl` with the application URL of your mobile service and `AppKey` with the application key. To learn how to obtain the application URL and application key for the mobile service, consult the tutorial [Add Mobile Services to an existing app](mobile-services-html-get-started-data.md).\n\n>[AZURE.IMPORTANT]The application key is intended to filter-out random request against your mobile service, and it is distributed with the application. Because this key is not encrypted, it cannot be considered secure. To truly secure your mobile service data, you must instead authenticate users before allowing access. For more information, see [How to: Authenticate users](#caching).\n\n##<a name=\"querying\"></a>How to: Query data from a mobile service\n\nAll of the code that accesses or modifies data in the SQL Database table calls functions on the `MobileServiceTable` object. You get a reference to the table by calling the `getTable()` function on an instance of the `MobileServiceClient`.\n\n    var todoItemTable = client.getTable('todoitem');\n\n\n### <a name=\"filtering\"></a>How to: Filter returned data\n\nThe following code illustrates how to filter data by including a `where` clause in a query. It returns all items from `todoItemTable` whose complete field is equal to `false`. `todoItemTable` is the reference to the mobile service table that we created previously. The where function applies a row filtering predicate to the query against the table. It accepts as its argument a JSON object or function that defines the row filter, and returns a query that can be further composed.\n\n    var query = todoItemTable.where({\n        complete: false\n    }).read().done(function (results) {\n        alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n        alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nBy adding calling `where` on the Query object and passing an object as a parameter, we are  instructing Mobile Services to return only the rows whose `complete` column contains the `false` value. Also, look at the request URI below, and notice that we are modifying the query string  itself:\n\n    GET /tables/todoitem?$filter=(complete+eq+false) HTTP/1.1\n\nYou can view the URI of the request sent to the mobile service by using message inspection software, such as browser developer tools or Fiddler.\n\nThis request would normally be translated roughly into the following SQL query on the server side:\n\n    SELECT *\n    FROM TodoItem\n    WHERE ISNULL(complete, 0) = 0\n\nThe object which is passed to the `where` method can have an arbitrary number of parameters, and they'll all be interpreted as AND clauses to the query. For example, the line below:\n\n    query.where({\n       complete: false,\n       assignee: \"david\",\n       difficulty: \"medium\"\n    }).read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nWould be roughly translated (for the same request shown before) as\n\n    SELECT *\n    FROM TodoItem\n    WHERE ISNULL(complete, 0) = 0\n          AND assignee = 'david'\n          AND difficulty = 'medium'\n\nThe `where` statement above and the SQL query above find incomplete items assigned to \"david\" of \"medium\" difficulty.\n\nThere is, however, another way to write the same query. A `.where` call on the Query object will add an `AND` expression to the `WHERE` clause, so we could have written that in three lines instead:\n\n    query.where({\n       complete: false\n    });\n    query.where({\n       assignee: \"david\"\n    });\n    query.where({\n       difficulty: \"medium\"\n    });\n\nOr using the fluent API:\n\n    query.where({\n       complete: false\n    })\n       .where({\n       assignee: \"david\"\n    })\n       .where({\n       difficulty: \"medium\"\n    });\n\nThe two methods are equivalent and may be used interchangeably. All the `where` calls so far take an object with some parameters, and are compared for equality against the data from the database. There is, however, another overload for the query method, which takes a function instead of the object. In this function we can then write more complex expressions, using operators such as inequality and other relational operations. In these functions, the keyword `this` binds to the server object.\n\nThe body of the function is translated into an Open Data Protocol (OData) boolean expression which is passed to a query string parameter. It is possible to pass in a function that takes no parameters, like so:\n\n    query.where(function () {\n       return this.assignee == \"david\" && (this.difficulty == \"medium\" || this.difficulty == \"low\");\n    }).read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\n\nIf passing in a function with parameters, any arguments after the `where` clause are bound to the function parameters in order. Any objects which come from the outside of the function scope MUST be passed as parameters - the function cannot capture any external variables. In the next two examples, the argument \"david\" is bound to the parameter `name` and in the first example, the argument \"medium\" is also bound to the parameter `level`. Also, the function must consist of a single `return` statement with a supported expression, like so:\n\n     query.where(function (name, level) {\n        return this.assignee == name && this.difficulty == level;\n     }, \"david\", \"medium\").read().done(function (results) {\n        alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n     }, function (err) {\n        alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n     });\n\nSo, as long as we follow the rules, we can add more complex filters to our database queries, like so:\n\n    query.where(function (name) {\n       return this.assignee == name &&\n          (this.difficulty == \"medium\" || this.difficulty == \"low\");\n    }, \"david\").read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nIt is possible to combine `where` with `orderBy`, `take`, and `skip`. See the next section for details.\n\n### <a name=\"sorting\"></a>How to: Sort returned data\n\nThe following code illustrates how to sort data by including an `orderBy` or `orderByDescending` function in the query. It returns items from `todoItemTable` sorted ascending by the `text` field. By default, the server returns only the first 50 elements.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] A server-driven page size us used by default to prevent all elements from being returned. This keeps default requests for large data sets from negatively impacting the service. \nYou may increase the number of items to be returned by calling `take` as described in the next section. `todoItemTable` is the reference to the mobile service table that we created previously.\n\n    var ascendingSortedTable = todoItemTable.orderBy(\"text\").read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\n    var descendingSortedTable = todoItemTable.orderByDescending(\"text\").read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\n    var descendingSortedTable = todoItemTable.orderBy(\"text\").orderByDescending(\"text\").read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\n### <a name=\"paging\"></a>How to: Return data in pages\n\nBy default, Mobile Services only returns 50 rows in a given request, unless the client explicitly asks for more data in the response. The following code shows how to implement paging in returned data by using the `take` and `skip` clauses in the query.  The following query, when executed, returns the top three items in the table.\n\n    var query = todoItemTable.take(3).read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nNotice that the `take(3)` method was translated into the query option `$top=3` in the query URI.\n\nThe following revised query skips the first three results and returns the next three after that. This is effectively the second \"page\" of data, where the page size is three items.\n\n    var query = todoItemTable.skip(3).take(3).read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nAgain, you can view the URI of the request sent to the mobile service. Notice that the `skip(3)` method was translated into the query option `$skip=3` in the query URI.\n\nThis is a simplified scenario of passing hard-coded paging values to the `take` and `skip` functions. In a real-world app, you can use queries similar to the above with a pager control or comparable UI to let users navigate to previous and next pages.\n\n### <a name=\"selecting\"></a>How to: Select specific columns\n\nYou can specify which set of properties to include in the results by adding a `select` clause to your query. For example, the following code returns the `id`, `complete`, and `text` properties from each row in the `todoItemTable`:\n\n    var query = todoItemTable.select(\"id\", \"complete\", \"text\").read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    })\n\nHere the parameters to the select function are the names of the table's columns that you want to return.\n\n\nAll the functions described so far are additive, so we can just keep calling them and we'll each time affect more of the query. One more example:\n\n    query.where({\n       complete: false\n    })\n       .select('id', 'assignee')\n       .orderBy('assignee')\n       .take(10)\n       .read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n\n### <a name=\"lookingup\"></a>How to: Look up data by ID\n\nThe `lookup` function takes only the `id` value, and returns the object from the database with that ID. Database tables are created with either an integer or string `id` column. A string `id` column is the default.\n\n    todoItemTable.lookup(\"37BBF396-11F0-4B39-85C8-B319C729AF6D\").done(function (result) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(result));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    })\n\n##<a name=\"odata-query\"></a>Execute an OData query operation\n\nMobile Services uses the OData query URI conventions for composing and executing REST queries.  Not all OData queries can be composed by using the built-in query functions, especially complex filter operations like searching for a substring in a property. For these kinds of complex queries, you can pass any valid OData query option string to the `read` function, as follows:\n\n    function refreshTodoItems() {\n        todoItemTable.read(\"$filter=substringof('search_text',text)\").then(function(items) {\n            var itemElements = $.map(items, createUiForTodoItem);\n            $(\"#todo-items\").empty().append(itemElements);\n            $(\"#no-items\").toggle(items.length === 0);\n        }, handleError);\n    }\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]When you provide a raw OData query option string into the `read` function, you cannot also use the query builder methods in the same query. In this case, you must compose your whole query as an OData query string. For more information on OData system query options, see the [OData system query options reference].\n\n##<a name=\"inserting\"></a>How to: Insert data into a mobile service\n\nThe following code illustrates how to insert new rows into a table. The client requests that a row of data be inserted by sending a POST request to the mobile service. The request body contains the data to be inserted, as a JSON object.\n\n    todoItemTable.insert({\n       text: \"New Item\",\n       complete: false\n    })\n\nThis inserts data from the supplied JSON object into the table. You can also specify a callback function to be invoked when the insertion is complete:\n\n    todoItemTable.insert({\n       text: \"New Item\",\n       complete: false\n    }).done(function (result) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(result));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\n###Working with ID values\n\nMobile Services supports unique custom string values for the table's **id** column. This allows applications to use custom values such as email addresses or user names for the ID. For example, the following code inserts a new item as a JSON object, where the unique ID is an email address:\n\n    todoItemTable.insert({\n       id: \"myemail@domain.com\",\n       text: \"New Item\",\n       complete: false\n    });\n\nString IDs provide you with the following benefits:\n\n+ IDs are generated without making a round-trip to the database.\n+ Records are easier to merge from different tables or databases.\n+ IDs values can integrate better with an application's logic.\n\nWhen a string ID value is not already set on an inserted record, Mobile Services generates a unique value for the ID. For more information on how to generate your own ID values, either on the client or in a .NET backend, see [How to: Generate unique ID values](mobile-services-how-to-use-server-scripts.md#generate-guids). \n\nYou can also use integer IDs for your tables. To use an integer ID, you must create your table with the `mobile table create` command using the `--integerId` option. This command is used with the Command-line Interface (CLI) for Azure. For more information on using the CLI, see [CLI to manage Mobile Services tables](../virtual-machines-command-line-tools.md#Mobile_Tables).\n\n##<a name=\"modifying\"></a>How to: Modify data in a mobile service\n\nThe following code illustrates how to update data in a table. The client requests that a row of data be updated by sending a PATCH request to the mobile service. The request body contains the specific fields to be updated, as a JSON object. It updates an existing item in the table `todoItemTable`.\n\n    todoItemTable.update({\n       id: idToUpdate,\n       text: newText\n    })\n\nThe first parameter specifies the instance to update in the table, as specified by its ID.\n\nYou can also specify a callback function to be invoked when the update is complete:\n\n    todoItemTable.update({\n       id: idToUpdate,\n       text: newText\n    }).done(function (result) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(result));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\n##<a name=\"deleting\"></a>How to: Delete data in a mobile service\n\nThe following code illustrates how to delete data from a table. The client requests that a row of data be deleted by sending a DELETE request to the mobile service. It deletes an existing item in the table todoItemTable.\n\n    todoItemTable.del({\n       id: idToDelete\n    })\n\nThe first parameter specifies the instance to delete in the table, as specified by its ID.\n\nYou can also specify a callback function to be invoked when the delete is complete:\n\n    todoItemTable.del({\n       id: idToDelete\n    }).done(function () {\n       /* Do something */\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\n##<a name=\"binding\"></a>How to: Display data in the user interface\n\nThis section shows how to display returned data objects using UI elements. To query items in `todoItemTable` and display it in a very simple list, you can run the following example code. No selection, filtering or sorting of any kind is done.\n\n    var query = todoItemTable;\n\n    query.read().then(function (todoItems) {\n       // The space specified by 'placeToInsert' is an unordered list element <ul> ... </ul>\n       var listOfItems = document.getElementById('placeToInsert');\n       for (var i = 0; i < todoItems.length; i++) {\n          var li = document.createElement('li');\n          var div = document.createElement('div');\n          div.innerText = todoItems[i].text;\n          li.appendChild(div);\n          listOfItems.appendChild(li);\n       }\n    }).read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nIn a Windows Store app, the results of a query can be used to create a [WinJS.Binding.List] object, which can be bound as the data source for a [ListView] object. For more information, see [Data binding (Windows Store apps using JavaScript and HTML)].\n\n##<a name=\"#custom-api\"></a>How to: Call a custom API\n\nA custom API enables you to define custom endpoints that expose server functionality that does not map to an insert, update, delete, or read operation. By using a custom API, you can have more control over messaging, including reading and setting HTTP message headers and defining a message body format other than JSON. For a complete example, including how to create a custom API in your mobile service, see [Call a custom API from the client].\n\nYou call a custom API from the client by calling the [invokeApi](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-services/blob/master/sdk/Javascript/src/MobileServiceClient.js#L337) method on **MobileServiceClient**. For example, the following line of code sends a POST request to the **completeAll** API on the mobile service:\n\n    client.invokeApi(\"completeall\", {\n        body: null,\n        method: \"post\"\n    }).done(function (results) {\n        var message = results.result.count + \" item(s) marked as complete.\";\n        alert(message);\n        refreshTodoItems();\n    }, function(error) {\n        alert(error.message);\n    });\n\n \nFor more realistic examples and a more a complete discussion of **invokeApi**, see [Custom API in Azure Mobile Services Client SDKs](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2013/06/19/custom-api-in-azure-mobile-services-client-sdks.aspx).\n\n##<a name=\"caching\"></a>How to: Authenticate users\n\nMobile Services supports authenticating and authorizing app users using a variety of external identity providers: Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter. You can set permissions on tables to restrict access for specific operations to only authenticated users. You can also use the identity of authenticated users to implement authorization rules in server scripts. For more information, see the [Get started with authentication] tutorial.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] When using authentication in a PhoneGap or Cordova app, you must also add the following plugins to the project:\n>\n>+ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-device.git\n>+ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser.git\n\n\nTwo authentication flows are supported: a _server flow_ and a _client flow_. The server flow provides the simplest authentication experience, as it relies on the provider's web authentication interface. The client flow allows for deeper integration with device-specific capabilities such as single-sign-on as it relies on provider-specific device-specific SDKs.\n\n###Server flow\nTo have Mobile Services manage the authentication process in your Windows Store or HTML5 app,\nyou must register your app with your identity provider. Then in your mobile service, you need to configure the application ID and secret provided by your provider. For more information, see the tutorial [Add authentication to your app](mobile-services-html-get-started-users.md).\n\nOnce you have registered your identity provider, simply call the [LoginAsync method] with the [MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider] value of your provider. For example, to login with Facebook use the following code.\n\n    client.login(\"facebook\").done(function (results) {\n         alert(\"You are now logged in as: \" + results.userId);\n    }, function (err) {\n         alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nIf you are using an identity provider other than Facebook, change the value passed to the `login` method above to one of the following: `microsoftaccount`, `facebook`, `twitter`, `google`, or `windowsazureactivedirectory`.\n\nIn this case, Mobile Services manages the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow by displaying the login page of the selected provider and generating a Mobile Services authentication token after successful login with the identity provider. The [login] function, when complete, returns a JSON object (**user**) that exposes both the user ID and Mobile Services authentication token in the **userId** and **authenticationToken** fields, respectively. This token can be cached and re-used until it expires. For more information, see [Caching the authentication token].\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] **Windows Store app**\nWhen you use the Microsoft Account login provider to authenticate users of your Windows Store app, you should also register the app package with Mobile Services. When you register your Windows Store app package information with Mobile Services, the client is able to re-use Microsoft Account login credentials for a single sign-on experience. If you do not do this, your Microsoft Account login users will be presented with a login prompt every time that the login method is called. To learn how to register your Windows Store app package, see [Register your Windows Store app package for Microsoft authentication](/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-windows-store-app-package/%20target=\"_blank\"). After the package information is registered with Mobile Services, call the [login](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=322050%20target=\"_blank\") method by supplying a value of **true** for the <em>useSingleSignOn</em> parameter to re-use the credentials.\n\n###Client flow\nYour app can also independently contact the identity provider and then provide the returned token to Mobile Services for authentication. This client flow enables you to provide a single sign-in experience for users or to retrieve additional user data from the identity provider.\n\nThe following example uses the Live SDK, which supports single-sign-on for Windows Store apps by using Microsoft Account:\n\n    WL.login({ scope: \"wl.basic\"}).then(function (result) {\n          client.login(\n                \"microsoftaccount\",\n                {\"authenticationToken\": result.session.authentication_token})\n          .done(function(results){\n                alert(\"You are now logged in as: \" + results.userId);\n          },\n          function(error){\n                alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n          });\n    });\n\nThis simplified example gets a token from Live Connect, which is supplied to Mobile Services by calling the [login] function. For a more complete example of how to use Microsoft Account to provide a single sign-in experience, see [Authenticate your app with single sign-in].\n\nWhen you are using the Facebook or Google APIs for client authentication, the example changes slightly.\n\n    client.login(\n         \"facebook\",\n         {\"access_token\": token})\n    .done(function (results) {\n         alert(\"You are now logged in as: \" + results.userId);\n    }, function (err) {\n         alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nThis example assumes that the token provided by the respective provider SDK is stored in the `token` variable.\nTwitter cannot be used for client authentication at this time. Microsoft Azure Active Directory cannot be used with JavaScript backends for client authentication at this time.\n\n###Caching the authentication token\nIn some cases, the call to the login method can be avoided after the first time the user authenticates. We can use [sessionStorage] or [localStorage] to cache the current user identity the first time they log in and every subsequent time we check whether we already have the user identity in our cache. If the cache is empty or calls fail (meaning the current login session has expired), we still need to go through the login process.\n\n    // After logging in\n    sessionStorage.loggedInUser = JSON.stringify(client.currentUser);\n\n    // Log in\n    if (sessionStorage.loggedInUser) {\n       client.currentUser = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.loggedInUser);\n    } else {\n       // Regular login flow\n   }\n\n     // Log out\n    client.logout();\n    sessionStorage.loggedInUser = null;\n\n##<a name=\"push-notifications\"></a>How to: Register for push notifications\n\nWhen your app is a PhoneGap or Apache Cordova HTML/JavaScript app, the native mobile platform enables you to receive push notifications on the device. The [Apache Cordova plugin for Azure Mobile Services](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-services-cordova) enables you to register for push notifications with Azure Notification Hubs. The specific notification service used depends on the native device platform on which the code executes. For an example of how to do this, see the sample, [Use Microsoft Azure to push notifications to Cordova apps](https://github.com/Azure/mobile-services-samples/tree/master/CordovaNotificationsArticle).\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]This plugin currently only supports iOS and Android devices. For a solution that also includes Windows devices, see the article [Push Notifications to PhoneGap Apps using Notification Hubs Integration](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/azuremobile/archive/2014/06/17/push-notifications-to-phonegap-apps-using-notification-hubs-integration.aspx).\n\n##<a name=\"errors\"></a>How to: Handle errors\n\nThere are several ways to encounter, validate, and work around errors in Mobile Services.\n\nAs an example, server scripts are registered in a mobile service and can be used to perform a wide range of operations on data being inserted and updated, including validation and data modification. Imagine defining and registering a server script that validate and modify data, like so:\n\n    function insert(item, user, request) {\n       if (item.text.length > 10) {\n          request.respond(statusCodes.BAD_REQUEST, { error: \"Text cannot exceed 10 characters\" });\n       } else {\n          request.execute();\n       }\n    }\n\nThis server-side script validates the length of string data sent to the mobile service and rejects strings that are too long, in this case longer than 10 characters.\n\nNow that the mobile service is validating data and sending error responses on the server-side, you can update your HTML app to be able to handle error responses from validation.\n\n    todoItemTable.insert({\n       text: itemText,\n       complete: false\n    })\n       .then(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (error) {\n       alert(JSON.parse(error.request.responseText).error);\n    });\n\n\nTo tease this out even further, you pass in the error handler as the second argument each time you perform data access:\n\n    function handleError(message) {\n       if (window.console && window.console.error) {\n          window.console.error(message);\n       }\n    }\n\n    client.getTable(\"tablename\").read()\n        .then(function (data) { /* do something */ }, handleError);\n\n##<a name=\"promises\"></a>How to: Use promises\n\nPromises provide a mechanism to schedule work to be done on a value that has not yet been computed. It is an abstraction for managing interactions with asynchronous APIs.\n\nThe `done` promise is executed as soon as the function provided to it has either successfully completed or has gotten an error. Unlike the `then` promise, it is guaranteed to throw any error that is not handled inside the function, and after the handlers have finished executing, this function throws any error that would have been returned from then as a promise in the error state. For more information, see [done].\n\n    promise.done(onComplete, onError);\n\nLike so:\n\n    var query = todoItemTable;\n    query.read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nThe `then` promise is the same as the as the `done` promise, but unlike the `then` promise, `done` is guaranteed to throw any error that is not handled inside the function. If you do not provide an error handler to `then` and the operation has an error, it does not throw an exception but rather returns a promise in the error state. For more information, see [then].\n\n    promise.then(onComplete, onError).done( /* Your success and error handlers */ );\n\nLike so:\n\n    var query = todoItemTable;\n    query.read().done(function (results) {\n       alert(JSON.stringify(results));\n    }, function (err) {\n       alert(\"Error: \" + err);\n    });\n\nYou can use promises in a number of different ways. You can chain promise operations by calling `then` or `done` on the promise that is returned by the previous `then` function. Use `then` for an intermediate stage of the operation (for example `.then().then()`), and `done` for the final stage of the operation (for example `.then().then().done()`).  You can chain multiple `then` functions, because `then` returns a promise. You cannot chain more than one `done` method, because it returns undefined.

You may want to add such a custom HTTP header if a server-side script needs it or may be enhanced by it.\n\n    var client = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient('https://your-app-url', 'your-key')\n       .withFilter(function (request, next, callback) {\n       request.headers.MyCustomHttpHeader = \"Some value\";\n       next(request, callback);\n    });\n\nFilters are used for a lot more than customizing request headers. They can be used to examine or change requests, examine or change  responses, bypass networking calls, send multiple calls, etc.\n\n##<a name=\"hostnames\"></a>How to: Use cross-origin resource sharing\n\nTo control which websites are allowed to interact with and send requests to your mobile service, make sure to add the host name of the website you use to host it to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) whitelist. For a JavaScript backend mobile service, you can configure the whitelist on the Configure tab in the [Azure Management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com). You can use wildcards if required. By default, new Mobile Services instruct browsers to permit access only from `localhost`, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows JavaScript code running in a browser on an external hostname to interact with your Mobile Service.  This configuration is not necessary for WinJS applications. \n\n<!-- Anchors. -->\n[What is Mobile Services]: #what-is\n[Concepts]: #concepts\n[How to: Create the Mobile Services client]: #create-client\n[How to: Query data from a mobile service]: #querying\n[Filter returned data]: #filtering\n[Sort returned data]: #sorting\n[Return data in pages]: #paging\n[Select specific columns]: #selecting\n[Look up data by ID]: #lookingup\n[How to: Display data in the user interface]: #binding\n[How to: Insert data into a mobile service]: #inserting\n[How to: Modify data in a mobile service]: #modifying\n[How to: Delete data in a mobile service]: #deleting\n[How to: Authenticate users]: #caching\n[How to: Handle errors]: #errors\n[How to: Use promises]: #promises\n[How to: Customize request headers]: #customizing\n[How to: Use cross-origin resource sharing]: #hostnames\n[Next steps]: #nextsteps\n[Execute an OData query operation]: #odata-query\n\n\n\n<!-- URLs. -->\n[then]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br229728.aspx\n[done]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701079.aspx\n[Learn more about the  differences between then and done]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh700334.aspx\n[how to handle errors in promises]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh700337.aspx\n\n[sessionStorage]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc197062(v=vs.85).aspx\n[localStorage]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc197062(v=vs.85).aspx\n\n[ListView]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211837.aspx\n[Data binding (Windows Store apps using JavaScript and HTML)]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh758311.aspx\n[login]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-services/blob/master/sdk/Javascript/src/MobileServiceClient.js#L301\n[Authenticate your app with single sign-in]: mobile-services-windows-store-javascript-single-sign-on.md\n[ASCII control codes C0 and C1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_escape_character#C1_set\n[OData system query options reference]: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=444502\n[Call a custom API from the client]: mobile-services-html-call-custom-api.md\n \n\ntest\n"
