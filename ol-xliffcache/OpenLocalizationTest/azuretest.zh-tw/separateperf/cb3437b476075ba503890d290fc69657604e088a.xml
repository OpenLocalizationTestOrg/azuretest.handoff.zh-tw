The release notes are continuously updated; as critical issues requiring a workaround are discovered, they are added. Before you deploy your Microsoft Azure StorSimple solution, consider the following information.  \n\n## Known issues in this release\nThe following table provides a summary of known issues in this release.  \n \n| No. | Feature | Issue | Comments/workaround | Applies to physical device | Applies to virtual device |\n|-----|---------|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1 | Factory reset | In some instances, when you perform a factory reset, the StorSimple device may be stuck and display this message: **Reset to factory is in progress (phase 8)**. This happens if you press CTRL+C while the cmdlet is in progress. | Do not press CTRL+C after initiating a factory reset. If you are already in this state, please contact Microsoft Support for next steps. | Yes | No |\n| 2 | Disk quorum | In rare instances, if the majority of disks in the EBOD enclosure of an 8600 device are disconnected resulting in no disk quorum, then the storage pool will be offline. It will stay offline even if the disks are reconnected. | You will need to reboot the device. If the issue persists, please contact Microsoft Support for next steps. | Yes | No |\n| 3 | Cloud snapshot failures | In rare instances, a cloud snapshot may fail with the error **Maximum backup limit reached**. This occurs if you exceed 255 online clones on the same device, from the same original volume which has been deleted. | | Yes | Yes |\n| 4 | Incorrect controller ID | When a controller replacement is performed, controller 0 may show up as controller 1. During controller replacement, when the image is loaded from the peer node, the controller ID can show up initially as the peer controllerâ€™s ID.
