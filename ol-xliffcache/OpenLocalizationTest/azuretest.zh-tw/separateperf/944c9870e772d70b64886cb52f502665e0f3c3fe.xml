For more information, see [Azure Active Directory editions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn532272.aspx).\n\nMicrosoft Azure AD Application Proxy lets you publish applications, such as SharePoint sites, Outlook Web Access and IIS-based apps, inside your private network and provides secure access to users outside your network. Employees can log into your apps from home, on their own devices and authenticate through this cloud-based proxy\n\nThis section walks you through enabling Microsoft Azure AD Application Proxy for your cloud directory in Azure AD, installing the Application Proxy Connector on your private network, registering the Connector with your Microsoft Azure AD tenant subscription.\n\n##Application Proxy prerequisites\nBefore you can enable and use Application Proxy services, you need to have:\n\n- An Microsoft Azure administrator account. If you don’t’ have one, you can get one here.\n- A server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows 8.1 or higher on which you can install the Application Proxy Connector. The server must be able to send HTTPS requests to the Application Proxy services in the cloud, and it must have an HTTPS connection to the applications that you intend to publish. \n- If a firewall is placed in the path, make sure the firewall is open to allow HTTPS (TCP) requests that originate from the Connector to the Application Proxy. The Connector uses these ports together with subdomains that are part of the high level domain: msappproxy.net. Make sure to open **all** the following ports to **outbound** traffic:\n\nPort Number | Description\n--- | ---\n80 | To enable outbound HTTP traffic for security validation.\n443 | To enable user authentication against Azure AD (required only for the Connector registration process)\n10100 - 10120 | To enable LOB HTTP responses sent back to the proxy\n9352, 5671 | To enable communication between the Connector toward the Azure service for incoming requests.\n9350 | Optional. To enable better performance for incoming requests.\n8080 | To enable the Connector bootstrap sequence and to enable Connector automatic update\n9090 | To enable Connector registration (required only for the Connector registration process)\n9091 | To enable Connector trust certificate automatic renewal\n \nIf your firewall enforces traffic according to originating users, open these ports for traffic coming from Windows services running as a Network Service. Also, make sure to enable port 8080 for NT Authority\\System.\n\n\n##Step 1: Enable Application Proxy in Azure AD\n1. Sign in as an administrator in the Azure Management Portal.\n2. Go to Active Directory and select the directory in which you want to enable Application Proxy.\n3. Click Configure, scroll down to Application Proxy and toggle Enable Application Proxy Services for this Directory to Enabled.\n\n    ![Enable Application Proxy](http://i.imgur.com/87woFzq.png) <p>\n4. Click Download now at the bottom of the screen. This will take you to the download page. Read and accept the license terms and click Download to save the Windows Installer file (.exe) for the Application Proxy Connector. \n\n##Step 2: Install and register the Connector\n1. Run AADApplicationProxyConnectorInstaller.exe on the server you prepared (see Application Proxy prerequisites).\n2. Follow the instructions in the wizard to install.\n3. During installation you will be prompted to register the Connector with your active Application Proxy account.\n<p>Provide your Azure AD global administrator credentials.\n- Make sure the admin who registers the Connector is in the same directory where you enabled the Application Proxy service, for example if the tenant domain is contoso.com, the admin should be admin@contoso.com or any other alias on that domain. And that you are a global administrator of the Azure AD tenant. Your global administrator tenant may be different from your Microsoft Azure credentials.\n- If IE Enhanced Security Configuration is set to On on the server where you are installing the Azure AD Connector, the registration screen might be blocked. If this happens, follow the instructions in the error message to allow access. Make sure that Internet Explorer Enhanced Security is off.\n- If Connector registration does not succeed, see Troubleshoot Application Proxy.\n\n4. When the installation completes, two new services are added to your server, as shown below. These are the Connector service, which enables connectivity, and an automated update service, which periodically checks for new versions of the Connector and updates the Connector as needed. Click Finish in the installation window to complete installation\n    ![Application Proxy Connector Service](http://i.imgur.com/zsVJKOz.png) <p>\n5. You are now ready to Publish applications with Application Proxy.\n\nIf you want to uninstall the Connector, after uninstalling the Connector service and the Updater service, make sure to restart your computer to fully remove the service.\n<p>For high availability purposes, you must deploy at least one additional Connector. To deploy an additional Connector, repeat steps 2 and 3, above. Each Connector must be registered separately.\n\n\n\n## Additional resources\n\n* [Sign up for Azure as an organization](..sign-up-organization.md)\n* [Azure Identity](..fundamentals-identity.md)\n\ntest\n"
