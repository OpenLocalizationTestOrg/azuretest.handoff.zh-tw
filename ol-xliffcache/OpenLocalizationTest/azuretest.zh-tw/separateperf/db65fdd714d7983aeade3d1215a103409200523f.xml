Unlike the previous [push notification][Get started with push notifications] tutorial, this tutorial changes your mobile service to require that a user be authenticated before the client can register with the notification hub for push notifications. Registration is also modified to add a tag based on the assigned user ID. Finally, the server code is updated to send the notification only to the authenticated user instead of to all registrations.\n \nThis tutorial supports both Windows Store and Windows Phone Store apps.\n\n##Prerequisites \n\nBefore you start this tutorial, you must have already completed these Mobile Services tutorials:\n\n+ [Get started with authentication]<br/>Adds a login requirement to the TodoList sample app.\n\n+ [Get started with push notifications]<br/>Configures the TodoList sample app for push notifications by using Notification Hubs. \n\nAfter you have completed both tutorials, you can prevent unauthenticated users from registering for push notifications from your mobile service.\n\n##<a name=\"register\"></a>Update the service to require authentication to register\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-push-notifications-app-users](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-push-notifications-app-users.md)] \n\n##<a name=\"update-app\"></a>Update the app to log in before registration\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-push-notifications-app-users](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-push-notifications-app-users.md)] \n\n##<a name=\"test\"></a>Test the app\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-test-push-users](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-test-push-users.md)] \n\n\n\n<!-- Anchors. -->\n[Updating the service to require authentication for registration]: #register\n[Updating the app to log in before registration]: #update-app\n[Testing the app]: #test\n[Next Steps]:#next-steps\n\n\n<!-- URLs. -->\n[Get started with authentication]: ../mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-users.md\n[Get started with push notifications]: ../mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-push.md\n\n[Azure Management Portal]: https://manage.windowsazure.com/\n\n \ntest\n"
