A DNS zone is used to host the DNS records for a particular domain.\n\nTo start hosting your domain, you first need to create a DNS zone. Any DNS record created for a particular domain will be inside a DNS zone for the domain.\n\nThese instructions use Microsoft Azure CLI. Be sure to update to the latest Azure CLI to use the Azure DNS commands.\n\n## Set up Azure CLI\n\n### Step 1\n\nInstall Azure CLI. You can install Azure CLI for Windows, Linux, or MAC. The following steps need to be completed before you can manage Azure DNS using Azure CLI. More information is available at [Install the Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md). All the network provider commands on CLI can be found using the following command:\n\n    Azure network\n\n\n>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] The DNS commands require Azure CLI version 0.9.8 or above. Type `azure -v`to check which Azure CLI version is currently installed in your machine.\n \n### Step 2\n\nAzure DNS uses Azure Resource Manager. Make sure you switch CLI to use arm commands and DNS.\n\n    Azure config mode arm\n\n### Step 3\n\nSign in to your Azure account.\n\n    Azure login -u \"username\"\n\nYou will be prompted to authenticate with your credentials. Keep in mind that you can only use ORGID accounts.\n\n### Step 4\nChoose which of your Azure subscriptions to use.\n\n    Azure account set \"subscription name\"\n\nTo see a list of available subscriptions, use the \"azure account list\" command.\n\n### Step 5\n\nCreate a new resource group (skip this step if using an existing resource group)\n\n    Azure group create -n myresourcegroup --location \"West US\"\n\nAzure Resource Manager requires that all resource groups specify a location. This is used as the default location for resources in that resource group. However, because all DNS resources are global, not regional, the choice of resource group location has no impact on Azure DNS.\n\n### Step 6\n\nThe Azure DNS service is managed by the Microsoft.Network resource provider. Your Azure subscription needs to be registered to use this resource provider before you can use Azure DNS. This is a one-time operation for each subscription.\n\n    Azure provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network\n\n## Tags\n\nTags are different from Etags. Tags are a list of name-value pairs, and are used by Azure Resource Manager to label resources for billing or grouping purposes. For more information about tags, see [Using tags to organize your Azure resources](resource-group-using-tags.md). Azure DNS CLI supports tags on both zones and record sets specified by using the options ‘-Tag’ parameter. The following example shows how to create a DNS zone with two tags, ‘project = demo’ and ‘env = test’:\n\n    Azure network dns zone create -n contoso.com -g myresourcegroup -t \"project=demo\";\"env=test\"\n\n## Create a DNS zone\n\nA DNS zone is created using the `azure network dns zone create` command. In the example below, you create a DNS zone called 'contoso.com' in the resource group called 'MyResourceGroup':\n\n    Azure network dns zone create -n contoso.com -g myresourcegroup\n\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] In Azure DNS, zone names should be specified without a terminating ‘.’, for example, as ‘contoso.com’ rather than ‘contoso.com.’.\n\n\nYour DNS zone has now been created in Azure DNS. Creating a DNS zone also creates the following DNS records:\n\n- The ‘Start of Authority’ (SOA) record. This is present at the root of every DNS zone.\n- The authoritative name server (NS) records. These show which name servers are hosting the zone. Azure DNS uses a pool of name servers, and so different name servers can be assigned to different zones in Azure DNS. See [Delegate a domain to Azure DNS](dns-domain-delegation.md) for more information.\n\nTo view these records, use \"azure network dns-record-set show\":\n\n    Usage: network dns record-set show <resource-group> <dns-zone-name> <name> <type>\n\n\nIn the example below, running the command with resource group \"myresourcegroup\", record set name \"@\" (for a root record) and type \"SOA\" will yield the following output:\n \n\n    azure network dns record-set show myresourcegroup \"contoso.com\" \"@\" SOA\n    info:    Executing command network dns-record-set show\n    + Looking up the DNS record set \"@\"\n    data:    Id                              : /subscriptions/#######################/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnszones/contoso.com/SOA/@\n    data:    Name                            : @\n    data:    Type                            : Microsoft.Network/dnszones/SOA\n    data:    Location                        : global\n    data:    TTL                             : 3600\n    data:    SOA record:\n    data:      Email                         : msnhst.microsoft.com\n    data:      Expire time                   : 604800\n    data:      Host                          : edge1.azuredns-cloud.net\n    data:      Minimum TTL                   : 300\n    data:      Refresh time                  : 900\n    data:      Retry time                    : 300\n    data:                                    :\n<BR>\nTo view the NS records created, use the following command:\n\n    azure network dns record-set show myresourcegroup \"contoso.com\" \"@\" NS\n    info:    Executing command network dns-record-set show\n    + Looking up the DNS record set \"@\"\n    data:    Id                              : /subscriptions/#######################/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnszones/contoso.com/NS/@\n    data:    Name                            : @\n    data:    Type                            : Microsoft.Network/dnszones/NS\n    data:    Location                        : global\n    data:    TTL                             : 3600\n    data:    NS records\n    data:        Name server domain name     : ns1-05.azure-dns.com\n    data:        Name server domain name     : ns2-05.azure-dns.net\n    data:        Name server domain name     : ns3-05.azure-dns.org\n    data:        Name server domain name     : ns4-05.azure-dns.info\n    data:\n    info:    network dns-record-set show command OK\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] Record sets at the root (or ‘apex’) of a DNS zone use \"@\" as the record set name.\n\nHaving created your first DNS zone, you can test it by using DNS tools such as nslookup, DIG, or the **Resolve-DnsName** PowerShell cmdlet.\nIf you haven’t yet delegated your domain to use the new zone in Azure DNS, you need to direct the DNS query directly to one of the name servers for your zone. The name servers for your zone are given in the NS records, as listed by \"azure network dns-record-set show\" above. Be sure the substitute the correct values for your zone in the command below.\n\nThe following example uses DIG to query the domain contoso.com using the name servers assigned for the DNS zone. The query has to point to a name server for which we used `@<name server for the zone>` and zone name using DIG.\n\n     <<>> DiG 9.10.2-P2 <<>> @ns1-05.azure-dns.com contoso.com\n    (1 server found)\n    global options: +cmd\n    Got answer:\n    ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 60963\n    flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1\n    WARNING: recursion requested but not available\n\n    OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\n    EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4000\n    QUESTION SECTION:\n    contoso.com.
