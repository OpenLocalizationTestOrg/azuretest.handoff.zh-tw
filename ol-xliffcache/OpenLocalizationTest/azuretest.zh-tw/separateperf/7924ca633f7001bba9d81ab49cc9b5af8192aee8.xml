If you want to analyze this data, click **Download Usage** and choose a comma-separated variable file (.csv) version to see your daily usage data for the appropriate billing period.  For your reference, you can download a sample .csv file for each version below.\n\n NAME | DOWNLOAD |\n :----------:| :-------: |\n  Detailed Usage .csv Version 1|  [Sample File](https://azurepricing.blob.core.windows.net/sampleinvoices/Micorosft_Azure_Detailed_Usage_v1.csv)\n  Detailed Usage .csv Version 2 | [Sample File](https://azurepricing.blob.core.windows.net/sampleinvoices/Micorosft_Azure_Detailed_Usage_v2.csv)\n\n\n\n![csv2screenshot](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/csv2screenshot.png)\n\n\n\nIn the .csv file, the items are broken down to display a list of how much of each resource was consumed within the current billing period.\n\n![csv snapshot](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/csvsnapshotportal.png)\n\nThe following columns display details that affect the rates at the beginning of the billing period:\n\n**Version 1** |  **Version 2**  |  **Description** |\n:---------------| :----------------| -----|\nUsage Date | Usage Date | The date when the resource was emitted.\nName | Meter Category | Identifies the top-level service for which this usage belongs.\nResource GUID | Meter ID | The billed meter identifier.  This is used as the identifier used to price billing usage.\nType | Meter Sub-Category | Azure service may be further defined by type in this column, which can affect the rate.\nResource | Meter Name | Identifies the unit of measure for the resource being consumed.\nRegion | Meter Region | Identifies the location of the datacenter for certain services that are priced based on datacenter location.\nUnit | Unit | Identifies the Unit that the service is charged in. For example, GB, hours, 10,000s.\nConsumed | Consumed Quantity | Contains the amount of the resource that has been consumed for that day.\nSub Region | Resource Location | Identifies the datacenter where the resource is running.\nService | Consumed Service | This column is utilized to track the individual Azure platform service that may not be specifically identified in the Name column. This Service column will indicate which specific service the usage pertains.\nN/A | Resource Group | _**New column addition.**_ The resource group in which the deployed resource is running in. Refer to http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/\nComponent | Instance ID | The identifier for the running resource. The identifier contains the name you specify for the resource when it was created.\nN/A | Tags | _**New column addition.**_ New resource types in Azure allow you to tag resources. Refer to http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/organize-your-azure-resources-with-tags/\nAdditional Info | Additional Info | Additional metadata related to the service.\nService Info 1 | Service Info 1 | This column provides the project name that the service belongs to on your subscription.\nService Info 2 | Service Info 2 | This is a legacy field that captures optional service specific metadata.\n\nIn addition to some new fields and name changes to csv Version 2, there will be standardized formatting for the data in the below fields:\n\n- **Instance ID**: The Instance ID field represents the user specified identifier for the service provisioned. Currently, there are two formats in which the Instance ID is represented: it is either the name of the Resource or the fully qualified Resource ID. Microsoft Azure services are transitioning to represent the Instance ID in a standardized fully qualified Resource ID format _**(/subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourcegroups/<resourcegroupname>/providers/<providername>/<resourcename>)**_. As services transition to the new format you will see the Instance ID data field change from just the resource name to Resource ID. The Resource ID is the format used by the [Azure Resource Manager API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790567.aspx) to identify resources in an a subscription.\n\n![instanceid](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/instanceid.png)\n\n- **Additional Info**: The Additional Info column in the usage .csv specifies service specific metadata. For example, an image type for a VM. Currently, a service emits service specific metadata in multiple columns: Additional Info, Service Info1, and Service Info 2 fields. Microsoft Azure services will be standardizing emitting service specific metadata in the Additional Info column only.  See the below snapshot of the standardized format:\n\n![additionalinfo_csv2](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/AdditionaInfo_csv2.png)\n\n- **Tags**:  This column contains the user specified resource tags. The tags can be used to group billing records. For example, you can use tags to distribute costs by department using the service. Learn more about [using tags to organize Azure Resources](/resource-group-using-tags.md/).  Services that support emitting tags are:\n    - Virtual Machines\n    - Storage and\n    - Networking services provisioned using the [Azure Resource Manager API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790567.aspx)\n\n![tags](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/tags.png)\n\n\nPlease see these additional sources for more details on each service. These files are updated on a monthly basis, published on the 25th for the coming month, and are available from **May 2015** onwards for .csv Version 1, and from **June 2015** onward for .csv Version 2.
