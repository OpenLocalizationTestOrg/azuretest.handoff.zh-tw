Once collected into Event Hubs, you can transform and store data using any real-time analytics provider or storage cluster.\n\nFor more information, please see [Event Hubs Overview].\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to ingest messages into an Event Hub using a console application in Java, and to retrieve them in parallel using the C# [Event Processor Host] library.\n\nIn order to complete this tutorial you will need the following:\n\n+ A Java development environment. For this tutorial, we will assume [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).\n\n+ Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows\n\n+ An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes.

Log on to the [Azure management portal], and click **NEW** at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. Click **App Services**, then **Service Bus**, then **Event Hub**, then **Quick Create**.\n\n    ![][1]\n\n3. Type a name for your Event Hub, select your desired region, and then click **Create a new Event Hub**.\n\n    ![][2]\n\n4. Click the namespace you just created (usually ***event hub name*-ns**).\n\n    ![][3]\n\n5. Click the **Event Hubs** tab at the top of the page, and then click the Event Hub you just created.\n\n    ![][4]\n\n6. Click the **Configure** tab at the top of the page, add a rule named **SendRule** with *Send* rights, add another rule called **ReceiveRule** with *Manage, Send, Listen* rights, and then click **Save**.\n\n    ![][5]\n\n7. On the same page, take note of the generated keys for **SendRule**.\n\n    ![][6b]\n\n8. Click the **Dashboard** tab at the top of the page, and then click **Connection Information**. Take note of the two connection strings.\n\n    ![][6]\n\nYour Event Hub is now created, and you have the connection strings you need to send and receive events.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-send-java](../../includes/service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-send-java.md)]\n\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-receive-ephcs](../../includes/service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-receive-ephcs.md)]\n\n## Run the applications\n\nNow you are ready to run the applications.\n\n1.  Run the **Receiver** project from Visual Studio, then wait for it to start the receivers for all the partitions.\n\n    ![][21]\n\n2.
