When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification from the JavaScript backend to all registered Windows Store and Windows Phone Store apps each time a record is inserted in the TodoList table. The notification hub that you create is free with your mobile service, can be managed independent of the mobile service, and can be used by other applications and services.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]This topic shows you how to use the tooling in Visual Studio 2013 with Update 3 to add support for push notifications from Mobile Services to a universal Windows app. The same steps can be used to add push notifications from Mobile Services to a Windows Store or Windows Phone Store 8.1 app. To add push notifications to a Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1 app, see this version of [Get started with push notifications in Mobile Services](mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-phone-get-started-push.md).\n\nThis tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:\n\n1.

Browse to the `\\Services\\MobileServices\\your_service_name` project folder, open the generated push.register.cs code file, and inspect the **UploadChannel** method that registers the device's channel URL with the notification hub.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Open the shared App.xaml.cs code file and notice that a call to the new **UploadChannel** method was added in the **OnLaunched** event handler. This makes sure that registration of the device is attempted whenever the app is launched.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Repeat the previous steps to add push notifications to the Windows Phone Store app project, then in the shared App.xaml.cs file, remove the extra call to **UploadChannel** and the remaining `#if...#endif` conditional wrapper. Both projects can now share a single call to **UploadChannel**. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that you can also simplify the generated code by unifying the `#if...#endif` wrapped [MobileServiceClient] definitions into a single  unwrapped definition used by both versions of the app.\n\nNow that push notifications are enabled in the app, you must update the mobile service to send push notifications. \n\n##<a id=\"update-service\"></a>Update the service to send push notifications\n\nThe following steps update the insert script registered to the TodoItem table.
