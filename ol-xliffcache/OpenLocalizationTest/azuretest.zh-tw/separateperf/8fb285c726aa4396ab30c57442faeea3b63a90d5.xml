You will reference this\n    connection string later in the code in this guide.  \n    ![Change connection string name][connection-string5]\n    \n### Configuring your connection string using .NET configuration\n\nIf you are writing an application that is not an Azure cloud service, (see previous section), it is recommended you use the .NET configuration system (e.g. `web.config` or `app.config`). This includes Azure Websites or Azure Virtual Machines, as well as applications designed to run outside of Azure. You store the connection string using the `<appSettings>` element as follows. Replace `account-name` with the name of your storage account, and `account-key` with your account access key:\n\n    <configuration>\n        <appSettings>\n            <add key=\"StorageConnectionString\" value=\"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=account-name;AccountKey=account-key\" />\n        </appSettings>\n    </configuration>\n\nFor example, the configuration setting in your config file may be similar to:\n\n    <configuration>\n        <appSettings>\n            <add key=\"StorageConnectionString\" value=\"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=storagesample;AccountKey=nYV0gln9fT7bvY+rxu2iWAEyzPNITGkhM88J8HUoyofpK7C8fHcZc2kIZp6cKgYRUM74lHI84L50Iau1+9hPjB==\" />\n        </appSettings>\n    </configuration>\n\nYou are now ready to perform the how-to tasks in this guide.\n\n[connection-string1]: ./media/storage-configure-connection-string-include/connection-string1.png\n[connection-string2]: ./media/storage-configure-connection-string-include/connection-string2.png\n[connection-string3]: ./media/storage-configure-connection-string-include/connection-string3.png\n[connection-string4]: ./media/storage-configure-connection-string-include/connection-string4.png\n[connection-string5]: ./media/storage-configure-connection-string-include/connection-string5.png\n\n[Configuring Connection Strings]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee758697.aspx"
