Open Server Manager and navigate to **Tools** > **Group Policy Management**.\n2. From Group Policy Management, navigate to the domain node that corresponds to the domain in which you would like to enable **Automatic Workplace Join**.\n3.

Set the Automatically workplace join client computers policy to disabled. This will prevent new devices from automatically joining the workplace.\n\nUnregister the existing domain joined Windows 8.1 machines by following one of the two options below:\n\n* Option 1: **Unregister a Windows 8.1 domain joined device using PC Settings**\n  1. On the Windows 8.1 device, navigate to **PC Settings** > **Network** > **Workplace**\n  2. Select **Leave**.\nThis process must be repeated for each domain user that has signed into the machine and has been automatically workplace joined.\n\n* Option 2: Unregister a Windows 8.1 domain joined device using a script\n    1.
