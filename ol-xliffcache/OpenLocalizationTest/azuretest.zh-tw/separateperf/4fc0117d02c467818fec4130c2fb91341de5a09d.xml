The Java sample relies on the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8. The sample connects to an Azure SQL Database by using the JDBC driver.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n\n- [Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server - SQL JDBC 4](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=11774).\n- Any operating system platform that runs [Java Development Kit 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).\n- An existing database on SQL Azure. See the [Get Started topic](sql-database-get-started.md) to learn how to create a sample database and retrieve your connection string.\n\n\n## Test environment\n\n\nThe Java code example in this topic assumes the following test table already exists in your Azure SQL Database database.\n\n\n<!--\nCould this instead be a #tempPerson table, so that the Java code sample could be fully self-sufficient and be runnable (with automatic cleanup)?\n-->\n\n\n    CREATE TABLE Person\n    (\n        id         INT    PRIMARY KEY    IDENTITY(1,1),\n        firstName  VARCHAR(32),\n        lastName   VARCHAR(32),\n        age        INT\n    );\n\n\n## Connection string for your SQL Database\n\n\nThe code sample creates a `Connection` object by using a connection string. You can find the connection string by using the [Azure preview portal](http://portal.azure.com/). For details about finding the connection string, see [Create your first Azure SQL Database](sql-database-get-started.md).\n\n\n## Java code sample\n\n\nThe section contains the bulk of the Java code sample. It has comments indicating where you would copy-and-paste the smaller Java segments that are presented in subsequent sections. The sample in this section could compile and run even without the copy-and-pastes near the comments, but it would only connect and then end. The comments you will find are the following:\n\n\n1. `// INSERT two rows into the table.`\n2. `// TRANSACTION and commit for an UPDATE.`\n3. `// SELECT rows from the table.`\n\n\nHere next is the bulk of the Java code sample. The sample includes the `main` function of the `SQLDatabaseTest` class.\n\n\n    import java.sql.*;\n    import com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.*;\n    \n    public class SQLDatabaseTest {\n    \n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            String connectionString =\n                \"jdbc:sqlserver://your_server.database.windows.net:1433;\" \n                + \"database=your_database;\"\n                + \"user=your_user@your_server;\"\n                + \"password={your_password};\"\n                + \"encrypt=true;\"\n                + \"trustServerCertificate=false;\"\n                + \"hostNameInCertificate=*.database.windows.net;\"\n                + \"loginTimeout=30;\"; \n    \n            // Declare the JDBC objects.\n            Connection connection = null;\n            Statement statement = null;\n            ResultSet resultSet = null;\n            PreparedStatement prepsInsertPerson = null;\n            PreparedStatement prepsUpdateAge = null;\n    \n            try {\n                connection = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionString);\n    \n                // INSERT two rows into the table.\n                // ...\n    \n                // TRANSACTION and commit for an UPDATE.\n                // ...\n    \n                // SELECT rows from the table.\n                // ...\n            }\n            catch (Exception e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n            finally {\n                // Close the connections after the data has been handled.\n                if (prepsInsertPerson != null) try { prepsInsertPerson.close(); } catch(Exception e) {}\n                if (prepsUpdateAge != null) try { prepsUpdateAge.close(); } catch(Exception e) {}\n                if (resultSet != null) try { resultSet.close(); } catch(Exception e) {}\n                if (statement != null) try { statement.close(); } catch(Exception e) {}\n                if (connection != null) try { connection.close(); } catch(Exception e) {}\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\nOf course, to actually run the preceding Java code sample, you would have to put your real values into the connection string to replace the placeholders:\n\n\n- your_server\n- your_database\n- your_user\n- your_password\n\n\n## INSERT two rows into the table\n\n\nThis Java segment issues a Transact-SQL INSERT statement to insert two rows into the Person table. The general sequence is as follows:\n\n\n1. Generate a `PreparedStatement` object by using the `Connection` object.\n - We include the parameter `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS` so that later we can obtain the value that was automatically generated for the **id** key value.\n2. Call the `execute` method on the `PreparedStatement` object.\n3. Obtain the numeric value that was automatically generated for the primary key, by using the `PreparedStatement` object.\n - This relates to the AUTO_INCREMENT specification on the **id** column in the Person table\n\n\nCopy-and-paste this short Java segment into the primary code sample where you see the comment `// INSERT two rows into the table.`.\n\n\n    // Create and execute an INSERT SQL prepared statement.\n    String insertSql = \"INSERT INTO Person (firstName, lastName, age) VALUES \"\n        + \"('Bill', 'Gates', 59), \"\n        + \"('Steve', 'Ballmer', 59);\";\n    \n    prepsInsertPerson = connection.prepareStatement(\n        insertSql,\n        Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS);\n    prepsInsertPerson.execute();\n    // Retrieve the generated key from the insert.\n    resultSet = prepsInsertPerson.getGeneratedKeys();\n    // Iterate through the set of generated keys.\n    while (resultSet.next()) {\n        System.out.println(\"Generated: \" + resultSet.getString(1));\n    }\n\n\n## TRANSACTION and commit for an UPDATE\n\n\nThe following segment of Java code issues a Transact-SQL UPDATE statement to increase the `age` value for every row in the person table. The general sequence is as follows:\n\n\n1. The `setAutoCommit` method is called to prevent updates from being automatically committed in the database.\n2. The `executeUpdate` method is called to execute the UPDATE in the context of transaction.\n3. The `commit` method is called to explicitly commit the transaction.\n\n\nCopy-and-paste this short Java segment into the primary code sample where you see the comment `// TRANSACTION and commit for an UPDATE.`.\n\n\n    // Set AutoCommit value to false to execute a single transaction at a time.\n    connection.setAutoCommit(false);\n    \n    // Write the SQL Update instruction and get the PreparedStatement object.\n    String transactionSql = \"UPDATE Person SET Person.age = Person.age + 1;\";\n    prepsUpdateAge = connection.prepareStatement(transactionSql);\n    \n    // Execute the statement.\n    prepsUpdateAge.executeUpdate();\n    \n    //Commit the transaction.\n    connection.commit();\n    \n    // Return the AutoCommit value to true.\n    connection.setAutoCommit(true);\n\n\n## SELECT rows from a table\n\n\nThis Java segment executes a Transact-SQL SELECT statement to see all the updated rows from the Person table. The general sequence is as follows:\n\n\n1. Generate a `Statement` object by using the `Connection` object.\n2. Generate a `ResultSet` object by using the `Statement` object.\n3. Loop around a call to `resultSet.next` to iterate through all the returned rows.\n\n\nCopy-and-paste this short Java segment into the primary code sample where you see the comment `// SELECT rows from a table.`.\n\n\n    // Create and execute a SELECT SQL statement.\n    String selectSql = \"SELECT firstName, lastName, age FROM dbo.Person\";\n    statement = connection.createStatement();\n    resultSet = statement.executeQuery(selectSql);\n    \n    // Iterate through the result set and print the attributes.\n    while (resultSet.next()) {\n        System.out.println(resultSet.getString(2) + \" \"\n            + resultSet.getString(3));\n    }\n\n "
