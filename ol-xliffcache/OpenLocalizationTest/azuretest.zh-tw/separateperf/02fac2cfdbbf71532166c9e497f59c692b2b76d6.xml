This includes Hive 0.13 and Tez support.\n\n## Version 1.0.0.0, released October 28, 2013\n\n* This is the generally available (GA) release of the Microsoft HDInsight Emulator for Azure, formerly known as Microsoft HDInsight Developer Preview. \n\n* As with the preview releases of this product, this release continues to target developer scenarios, and as such supports only single-node deployments. \n\n### What's new? \n \n* Scripts have been added to simplify setting all Apache Hadoop services to automatic or manual start. The default will still be automatic as before, but all services can now be changed via the set-onebox-manualstart.cmd or set-onebox-autostart.cmd scripts that are installed in C:\\Hadoop. \n\n* The number of required installation dependencies has been reduced significantly, allowing for faster installations. \n\n* This version includes a bug fix in the command used to run Pig samples in the RunSamples.ps1 script installed in the GettingStarted folder. \n\n* This version contains an update to Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) version 1.1 that matches the Hortonworks Data Platform services available with Azure HDInsight cluster version 1.6. \n\n## Version 0.11.0.0, released September 30, 2013\n\n### What's new? \n        \n* The HDInsight dashboard has been removed. \n\n* This version contains an update to the Hortonworks Data Platform Developer Preview that matches with the Hortonworks Data Platform Preview on Azure HDInsight. \n\n## Version 0.10.0.0, released August 9, 2013\n\n### What's new? \n    \n* This version contains an update to the Hortonworks Data Platform Developer Preview that matches with the Hortonworks Data Platform Preview on Azure HDInsight.\n\n## Version 0.8.0.0, released June 7, 2013\n\n### What's new? \n\n* This version contains an update to the Hortonworks Data Platform Developer Preview that matches with the Hortonworks Data Platform Preview on Azure HDInsight.\n\n## Version 0.6.0.0, released May 13, 2013\n\n### What's new? \n\n* Hive Server 2 is now being installed. This is required for version 0.9.2.0 of the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Hive, which was released at the same time as this update. \n\n* All services are set to automatic startup, so no more having to start everything again after a machine reboot. \n\n## Version 0.4.0.0, released March 25, 2013\n\n### What's new? \n\n* New release of Microsoft HDInsight Developer Preview as well as Hortonworks Data Platform for Windows Developer Preview. \n\n* Includes Apache Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Sqoop, Oozie, HCatalog, and Templeton. \n\n* New HDInsight dashboard with the following features: \n \n    * Connect to multiple clusters, including the local installation as well as those running remotely via the Azure HDInsight service. For more information on the HDInsight service, see [http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/hdinsight/](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/hdinsight/).\n \n    * Configure Azure Blob storage on the local cluster. See detailed instructions below.\n\n    * Author and edit Hive queries in the new interactive Hive console.\n\n    * View and download job history and results.\n\n### Release notes \n\n* The REST API endpoints on a local HDInsight installation and the Azure HDInsight service are accessed through different port numbers for the same services: \n\n    Local: \n    Oozie - http://localhost:11000/oozie/v1/admin/status \n    Templeton - http://localhost:50111/templeton/v1/status \n    ODBC - use port 10000 in DSN configuration or connection string \n\n    HDInsight service: \n    Oozie - http://ServerFQDN:563/oozie/v1/admin/status \n    Templeton - http://ServerFQDN:563/templeton/v1/status \n    ODBC - use port 563 in DSN configuration or connection string \n\n\n* Configuring Azure Blob storage on the local cluster: \n\n    In the dashboard, you will see a default local cluster named \"local (hdfs)\". If you want Azure Blob storage as your storage for your local installation, do the following: \n\n    1. Add the account tag in core-site.xml found in C:\\Hadoop\\hadoop-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\\conf:       \n\n            <property>\n                <name>fs.azure.account.key.{AccountName}</name>\n                <value>{Key}</value>\n            </property>\n\n            <property>\n                <name>fs.default.name</name>\n                <!-- cluster variant -->\n                <value>asv://ASVContainerName@ASVAccountName</value>\n                <description>The name of the default file system.  Either the literal string \"local\" or a host:port for NDFS.</description>\n                <final>true</final>\n            </property>\n\n            <property>\n                <name>dfs.namenode.rpc-address</name>\n                <value>hdfs://localhost:8020</value>\n                <description>A base for other temporary directories.</description>\n            </property>\n      \n        Example:       \n\n            <property>\n                <name>fs.azure.account.key.MyHadoopOnAzureAccountName</name>\n                <value>8T45df897/a5fSox1yMjYkX66CriiGgA5zptSXpPdG4o1Qw2mnbbWQN1E9i/i7kihk6FWNhvLlqe02NXEVw6rP==</value>\n            </property>\n\n            <property>\n                <name>fs.default.name</name>\n                <!-- cluster variant -->\n                <value>asv://MyASVContainer@MyASVAccount</value>\n                <description>The name of the default file system.  Either the literal string \"local\" or a host:port for NDFS.</description>\n                <final>true</final>\n            </property>\n        \n\n    2. Open the Hadoop command shell on your desktop in elevated mode and run the following command:\n     \n            %HADOOP_NODE%\\stop-onebox.cmd && %HADOOP_NODE%\\start-onebox.cmd\n\n    3. Access any file on that account by using the full URI: asv://{container}@{account}/{path} (or asvs:// if you want to use HTTPS for accessing the data). Example:\n     \n            hadoop fs -lsr \n            asvs://MyHadoopOnAzureContainerName@MyHadoopOnAzureAccountName/example/data/\n\n    4. Delete the currently registered local cluster and re-register it with the new Azure Blob storage credentials. \n\n\n## Version 0.3.0.0, released December 13, 2012 \n\n* The dashboard website has been changed to anonymous authentication instead of using Windows credentials. This eliminates the issue with the login prompt mentioned in the release notes for the previous version. \n\n* Some Sqoop bugs with export, and some types of imports, have been fixed. \n\n### Release issues \n\n* The JavaScript console fails to load. See release notes for version 0.2.0.0 for details. \n* The Sqoop command line will display warnings as shown below. These will be fixed in a future update and can be safely ignored. \n    \n        c:\\Hadoop\\sqoop-1.4.2\\bin>sqoop version \n        Setting HBASE_HOME to \n        Warning: HBASE_HOME [c:\\hadoop\\hadoop-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\\hbase-0.94.2] does not exist HBase imports will fail. \n        Please set HBASE_HOME to the root of your HBase installation. \n        Setting ZOOKEEPER_HOME to \n        Warning: ZOOKEEPER_HOME [c:\\hadoop\\hadoop-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\\zookeeper-3.4.3] does not exist \n        Please set $ZOOKEEPER_HOME to the root of your Zookeeper installation. \n        Sqoop 1.4.2 \n        git commit id 3befda0a456124684768348bd652b0542b002895 \n        Compiled by  on Thu 11/29/2012- 3:26:26.10\n\n## Version 0.2.0.0, released December 3, 2012\n\n* Introduction of semantic versioning to Windows Installer \n\n* Fixes for various installation bugs reported on the MSDN forums, particularly around installing the HDInsight dashboard \n\n* **Start** menu items added for increased discoverability \n\n* Fix for Hive console multi-line input \n\n* Minor updates to getting-started content \n\n### Release issues \n\n* The JavaScript console fails to load. \n\n    * On some installations, the JavaScript console will fail with an HTTP 404 error displayed on the page. To work around this, navigate directly to http://localhost:8080 to use the console. \n\n* Browsing to HDInsight Dashboard raises a login prompt. \n\n    * We've had some reports of a login dialog being raised during browsing to the HDInsight dashboard. In that case, you can provide the login information for your current user, and you should be able to browse to the dashboard. \n\n\n## Version 1.0.0.0, released October 23, 2012\n\n* Initial release \n\n### Release issues \n\n* Hive console \n\n    * If a newline is included in the Hive command submitted, you will get a syntax error. Remove newlines and the query should execute as intended. \n\n\n\n## General known issues\n\n* Hadoop user password expiration \n\n    The password for the Hadoop user may expire, dependent upon your Active Directory policies pushed to the machine. The following Windows PowerShell script will set the password to not expire, and can be run from an administrative command prompt:    \n\n        $username = \"hadoop\"\n        $ADS_UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD = 0x10000 # (65536, from ADS_USER_FLAG_ENUM enumeration)\n\n        $computer = [ADSI](\"WinNT://$ENV:COMPUTERNAME,computer\")\n        $users = $computer.psbase.children | where { $_.psbase.schemaclassname -eq \"User\" }\n\n        foreach($user in $users)\n        {\n            if($user.Name -eq $username)\n            {\n                $user.UserFlags = $ADS_UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD\n                $user.SetInfo()\n \n                $user.PasswordExpired = 0\n                $user.SetInfo()\n \n                Write-Host \"$username user maintenance completed. \"\n            }\n        }\n\n\n* Temp directory \n    \n    The hadoop.tmp.dir file points to the wrong location. Rather than pointing C:\\hadoop\\hdfs, it points to c:\\hdfs. This bug will be fixed in the next update of HDP bits. \n\n* OS restrictions \n\n    The HDInsight server must be installed on a 64-bit OS. \n\n* Web Platform Installer (WebPI) search results \n\n    HDInsight can't be found in WebPI search results. This is typically due to an OS restriction. HDInsight requires a 64-bit operating system with a minimum version of Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, Windows 8, or Windows Server 2012.\n\n* Administrative command prompt documentation \n\n    * In order to run commands such as **hadoop mradmin** or **hadoop defadmin**, you must run as the Hadoop user. \n\n    * To easily create a shell running as that user, open a Hadoop command prompt and run the following: \n     \n            start-hadoopadminshell\n\n    * This will open a new command shell running with Hadoop administrator privileges. \n\n##<a name=\"nextsteps\"></a> Next steps\n\n- [Get started with the HDInsight Emulator][hdinsight-hadoop-emulator-get-started]\n\n\n\n\n[hdinsight-hadoop-emulator-get-started]: ../hdinsight-get-started-emulator.md\n\n \ntest\n"
