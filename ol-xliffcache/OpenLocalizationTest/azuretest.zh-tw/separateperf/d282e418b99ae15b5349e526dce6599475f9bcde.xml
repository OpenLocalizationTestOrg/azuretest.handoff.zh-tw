At the top of the DocumentDB account or database blade, simply click the **Document Explorer** command.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the Document Explorer command](./media/documentdb-view-JSON-document-explorer/documentexplorercommand.png)\n \n2. Alternatively, near the bottom of each blade is a **Developer Tools** lens that contains the **Document Explorer** part.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the Document Explorer part](./media/documentdb-view-JSON-document-explorer/documentexplorerpart.png)\n\n2. Simply click the tile to launch Document Explorer.\n\n    <p>The **Database** and **Collection** drop-down list boxes are pre-populated depending on the context in which you launch Document Explorer.  For example, if you launch from a database blade, then the current database is pre-populated.  If you launch from a collection blade, then the current collection is pre-populated.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Document Explorer](./media/documentdb-view-JSON-document-explorer/documentexplorerinitial.png)\n\n3. By default, Document Explorer loads up to the first 100 documents in the selected collection, by their created date from earliest to latest.  You can load additional documents (in batches of 100) by selecting the **Load more** option at the bottom of the Document Explorer blade.  The default behavior can be modified by clicking the Settings command at the top of the Document Explorer blade.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Document Explorer Settings Blade](./media/documentdb-view-JSON-document-explorer/documentexplorersettings.png)\n\n\n4. On the Settings blade, you can adjust the number of items to return per page as well as provide a WHERE clause to load matching documents in the Document Explorer grid.
