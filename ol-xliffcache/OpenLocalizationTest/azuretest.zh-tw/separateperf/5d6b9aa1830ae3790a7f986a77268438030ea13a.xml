It is possible to\nregister multiple subscriptions to a topic. When a message is sent to a\ntopic, it is then made available to each subscription to handle/process\nindependently.\n\nA subscription to a topic resembles a virtual queue that receives copies of\nthe messages that were sent to the topic. You can optionally register\nfilter rules for a topic on a per-subscription basis, which allows you\nto filter/restrict which messages to a topic are received by which topic\nsubscriptions.\n\nService Bus topics and subscriptions enable you to scale to process a\nvery large number of messages across a very large number of users and\napplications.\n\n## Create a service namespace\n\nTo begin using Service Bus topics and subscriptions in Azure,\nyou must first create a service namespace. A service namespace provides\na scoping container for addressing Service Bus resources within your\napplication.\n\nTo create a service namespace:\n\n1.  Log on to the [Azure Management Portal][].\n\n2.  In the left navigation pane of the Management Portal, click\n    **Service Bus**.\n\n3.  In the lower pane of the Management Portal, click **Create**.\n    ![][0]\n\n4.  In the **Add a new namespace** dialog, enter a namespace name.\n    The system immediately checks to see if the name is available.\n    ![][2]\n\n5.  After making sure the namespace name is available, choose the\n    country or region in which your namespace should be hosted (make\n    sure you use the same country/region in which you are deploying your\n    compute resources).\n\n    IMPORTANT: Pick the **same region** that you intend to choose for\n    deploying your application. This will give you the best performance.\n\n6.  Leave the other fields in the dialog with their default values (**Messaging** and **Standard Tier**), then click the check mark. The system now creates your service\n    namespace and enables it. You might have to wait several minutes as\n    the system provisions resources for your account.\n\n    ![][6]\n\n\n## Obtain the default management credentials for the namespace\n\nIn order to perform management operations, such as creating a topic or\nsubscription on the new namespace, you must obtain the management\ncredentials for the namespace. You can obtain these credentials from the Azure management portal.\n\n### To obtain management credentials from the portal\n\n1.  In the left navigation pane, click the **Service Bus** node to\n    display the list of available namespaces:\n    ![][0]\n\n2.  Click on the namespace you just created from the list shown:\n    ![][3]\n\n3.  Click **Configure** to view the shared access policies for your namespace.\n    ![](./media/service-bus-java-how-to-create-topic/sb-queues-14.png)\n\n4.  Make a note of the primary key, or copy it to the clipboard.\n\n\n  [Azure Management Portal]: http://manage.windowsazure.com\n  [0]: ./media/service-bus-java-how-to-create-topic/sb-queues-13.png\n  [2]: ./media/service-bus-java-how-to-create-topic/sb-queues-04.png\n  [3]: ./media/service-bus-java-how-to-create-topic/sb-queues-09.png\n  [4]: ./media/service-bus-java-how-to-create-topic/sb-queues-06.png\n\n  [6]: ./media/service-bus-java-how-to-create-topic/getting-started-multi-tier-27.png\n  [34]: ./media/service-bus-java-how-to-create-topic/VSProperties.png\n"
