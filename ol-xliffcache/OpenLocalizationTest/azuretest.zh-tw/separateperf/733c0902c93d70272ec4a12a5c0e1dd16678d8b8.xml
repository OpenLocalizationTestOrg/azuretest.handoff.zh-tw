If you chose Absolute time range, it will show the same data every time.\n\n### Reset the blade\n\nIf you edit a blade but then you'd like to get back to the original saved set, just click Reset.\n\n![In the buttons at the top of Metric Explorer](./media/app-insights-metrics-explorer/17-reset.png)\n\n## Creating a search page\n\nOpen diagnostic search:\n\n![Open diagnostic search](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/01-open-Diagnostic.png)\n\nOpen the Filter blade and choose the event types you want to see. (If, later, you want to restore the filters with which you opened the blade, click Reset.)\n\n![Choose Filter and select telemetry types](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/02-filter-req.png)\n\n### Filter on property values\n\nYou can filter events on the values of their properties. The available properties depend on the event types you selected. \n\nFor example, pick out requests with a specific response code.\n\n![Expand a property and choose a value](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/03-response500.png)\n\nChoosing no values of a particular property has the same effect as choosing all values; it switches off filtering on that property.\n\n\n### Narrow your search\n\nNotice that the counts to the right of the filter values show how many occurrences there are in the current filtered set. \n\nIn this example, it's clear that the `Reports/Employees` request results in the majority of the 500 errors:\n\n![Expand a property and choose a value](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/04-failingReq.png)\n\nAdditionally if you want to also see what other events were happening during this time, you can check **Include events with undefined properties**.\n\n### Save your search\n\nWhen you've set all the filters you want, you can save the search as a favorite. If you work in an organizational account, you can choose whether to share it with other team members.\n\n![Click Favorite, set the name, and click Save](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/08-favorite-save.png)\n\n\nTo see the search again, **go to the overview blade** and open Favorites:\n\n![Favorites tile](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/09-favorite-get.png)\n\nIf you saved with Relative time range, the re-opened blade has the latest data. If you saved with Absolute time range, you see the same data every time.\n\n\ntest\n"
