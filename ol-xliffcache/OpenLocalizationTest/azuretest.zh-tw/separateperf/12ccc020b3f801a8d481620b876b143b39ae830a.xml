Most problems you may run into can be solved with a few simple troubleshooting steps which you can read about below to  troubleshoot your deployment:\n\n* [**Information to include when you need help**](#information-to-include-when-you-need-help)\n* [**Problems with Password Management configuration in the Azure Management Portal**](#troubleshoot-password-reset-configuration-in-the-azure-management-portal)\n* [**Problems with Password Managment reports in the Azure Management Portal**](#troubleshoot-password-management-reports-in-the-azure-management-portal)\n* [**Problems with the Password Reset Registration Portal**](#troubleshoot-the-password-reset-registration-portal)\n* [**Problems with the Password Reset Portal**](#troubleshoot-the-password-reset-portal)\n* [**Problems with Password Writeback**](#troubleshoot-password-writeback)\n  - [Password Writeback event log error codes](#password-writeback-event-log-error-codes)\n  - [Problems with Password Writeback connectivity](#troubleshoot-password-writeback-connectivity)\n\nIf you've tried the troubleshooting steps below and are still running into problems, you can post a question on the [Azure AD Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=WindowsAzureAD) or contact support and we'll take a look at your problem as soon as we can.\n\n## Information to include when you need help\n\nIf you cannot solve your issue with the guidance below, you can contact our support engineers. When you contact them, it is recommended to include the following information:\n\n - **General description of the error** – what exact error message did the user see?  If there was no error message, describe the unexpected behavior you noticed, in detail.\n - **Page** – what page were you on when you saw the error (include the URL)?\n - **Date / Time / Timezone** – what was the precise date and time you saw the error (include the timezone)?\n - **Support Code** – what was the support code generated when the user saw the error (to find this, reproduce the error, then click the Support Code link at the bottom of the screen and send the support engineer the GUID that results). \n   - If you are on a page without a support code at the bottom, press F12 and search for SID and CID and send those two results to the support engineer.\n\n    ![][001]\n\n - **User ID** – what was the ID of the user who saw the error (e.g. user@contoso.com)?\n - **Information about the user** – was the user federated, password hash synced, cloud only?  Did the user have an AAD Premium or AAD Basic license assigned?\n - **Application Event Log** – if you are using Password Writeback and the error is in your on-premises infrastructure, please zip up a copy of your application event log from your Azure AD Connect server and send along with your request.\n\nIncluding this information will help us to solve your problem as quickly as possible.\n\n\n## Troubleshoot password reset configuration in the Azure Management Portal\nIf you encounter an error when configuring password reset, you might be able to resolve it by following the troubleshooting steps below:\n\n<table>\n          <tbody><tr>\n            <td>\n              <p>\n                <strong>Error Case</strong>\n              </p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              <p>\n                <strong>What error does a user see?</strong>\n              </p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              <p>\n                <strong>Solution</strong>\n              </p>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              <p>I don’t see the <strong>User Password Reset Policy </strong>section under the <strong>Configure</strong> tab in the Azure management portal</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              <p>The <strong>User Password Reset Policy </strong>section is not visible on the <strong>Configure</strong> tab in the Azure Management Portal.</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              <p>This can occur if you do not have an AAD Premium or AAD Basic license assigned to the admin performing this operation. </p>\n              <p>To rectify this, assign an AAD Premium or AAD Basic license to the admin account in question by navigating to the <strong>Licenses</strong> tab and try again.</p>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              <p>I don’t see any of the configuration options under the <strong>User Password Reset Policy</strong> section that are described in the documentation.</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              <p>The <strong>User Password Reset Policy </strong>section is visible, but the only flag that appears under it is the <strong>Users Enabled for Password Reset</strong> flag.</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              <p>The rest of the UI will appear when you switch the <strong>Users Enabled for Password Reset</strong> flag to <strong>Yes.</strong></p>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              <p>I don’t see a particular configuration option.</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              <p>For example, I do not see the <strong>Number of days before a user must confirm their contact data</strong> option when I scroll through the <strong>User Password Reset Policy</strong> section (or other examples of the same issue).</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              <p>Many elements of UI are hidden until they are needed.

As an administrator, click **Start** on the server running **Azure AD Connect**.\n 2. Type **“services.msc”** in the search box and press **Enter**.\n 3. Look for the **Microsoft Azure AD Connect** entry.\n 4. Right-click on the service entry, click **Restart**, and wait for the operation to complete.\n\n    ![][002]\n\nThese steps will re-establish your connection with the cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing.  If restarting the Sync Service does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try to disable and re-enable the Password Writeback feature as a next step.\n\n### Disable and re-enable the Password Writeback feature\nDisabling and re-enabling the Password Writeback feature can help to resolve connectivity issues.\n\n 1. As an administrator, open the **Azure AD Connect configuration wizard**.\n 2. On the **Connect to Azure AD** dialog, enter your **Azure AD global admin credentials**\n 3. On the **Connect to AD DS** dialog, enter your **AD Domain Services admin credentials**.\n 4. On the **Uniquely identifying your users** dialog, click the **Next** button.\n 5. On the **Optional features** dialog, uncheck the **Password write-back** checkbox.\n\n    ![][003]\n\n 6. Click **Next** through the remaining dialog pages without changing anything until you get to the **Ready to configure** page.\n 7. Ensure that the configure page shows the **Password write-back option as disabled** and then click the green **Configure** button to commit your changes.\n 8. On the **Finished** dialog, deselect the **Synchronize now** option, and then click **Finish** to close the wizard.\n 9. Re-open the **Azure AD Connect configuration wizard**.\n 10.    **Repeat steps 2-8**, except ensure you **check the Password write-back option** on the **Optional features** screen to re-enable the service.\n\n    ![][004]\n\nThese steps will re-establish your connection with our cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing. \n\nIf disabling and re-enabling the Password Writeback feature does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try to re-install Azure AD Connect as a next step.\n\n### Install the latest Azure AD Connect release\nRe-installing the Azure AD Connect package will resolve any configuration issues which may be affecting your ability to either connect to our cloud services or to manage passwords in your local AD environment. \nWe recommend, you perform this step only after attempting the first two steps described above.\n\n 1. Download the latest version of Azure AD Connect [here](active-directory-aadconnect.md#download-azure-ad-connect).\n 2. Since you have already installed Azure AD Connect, you will only need to perform an in-place upgrade to update your Azure AD Connect installation to the latest version.\n 3. Execute the downloaded package and follow the on-screen instructions to update your Azure AD Connect machine.  No additional manual steps are required unless you have customized the out of box sync rules, in which case you should **back these up before proceeding with upgrade and manually re-deploy them after you are finished**.\n\nThese steps will re-establish your connection with our cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing. \n\nIf installing the latest version of the Azure AD Connect server does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try disabling and re-enabling Password Writeback as a final step after installing the latest sync QFE. \n\nIf that does not resolve your issue, then we recommend that you take a look at [Troubleshoot Password Writeback](#troubleshoot-password-writeback) and the [Azure AD password Management FAQ](active-directory-passwords-faq.md) to see if your issue may be discussed there.\n\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n\n* [What is Password Management](active-directory-passwords.md)\n* [How Password Management works](active-directory-passwords-how-it-works.md)\n* [Getting started with Password Mangement](active-directory-passwords-getting-started.md)\n* [Customize Password Management](active-directory-passwords-customize.md)\n* [Password Management Best Practices](active-directory-passwords-best-practices.md)\n* [How to get Operational Insights with Password Management Reports](active-directory-passwords-get-insights.md)\n* [Password Management FAQ](active-directory-passwords-faq.md)\n* [Learn More](active-directory-passwords-learn-more.md)\n* [Password Management on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn510386.aspx)\n\n\n\n\n[001]: ./media/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot/001.jpg \"Image_001.jpg\"\n[002]: ./media/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot/002.jpg \"Image_002.jpg\"\n[003]: ./media/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot/003.jpg \"Image_003.jpg\"\n[004]: ./media/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot/004.jpg \"Image_004.jpg\"\n\n \ntest\n"
