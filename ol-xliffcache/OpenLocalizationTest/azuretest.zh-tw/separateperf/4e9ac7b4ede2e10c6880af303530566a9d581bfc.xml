Please wait until the current Discovery operation has completed. | None |\n\n## Register\n| Backup operation | Error details | Workaround |\n| -------- | -------- | -------|\n| Register | Azure VM role is not in a state to install extension – Please check if the VM is in the Running state. Azure Recovery Services extension requires the VM to be Running. | Start the virtual machine and when it is in the Running state, retry the register operation.|\n| Register | Number of data disks attached to the virtual machine exceeded the supported limit - Please detach some data disks on this virtual machine and retry the operation. Azure backup supports up to 16 data disks attached to an Azure virtual machine for backup | None |\n| Register | Microsoft Azure Backup encountered an internal error - Wait for a few minutes and then try the operation again. If the issue persists, contact Microsoft Support. | You can get this error due to one of the following unsupported configurations: <ol><li>Premium LRS <li>Multi NIC <li>Load balancer </ol> |\n| Register | Registration failed with Install Agent operation timeout | Check if the OS version of the virtual machine is supported. |\n| Register | Command execution failed - Another operation is in progress on this item. Please wait until the previous operation is completed | None |\n| Register | Virtual machines having virtual hard disks stored on Premium storage are not supported for backup | None |\n| Register | Virtual machine agent is not present on the virtual machine - Please install the required pre-requisite, VM agent and restart the operation. | [Read more](#vm-agent) about VM agent installation, and how to validate the VM agent installation. |\n\n## Backup\n\n| Backup operation | Error details | Workaround |\n| -------- | -------- | -------|\n| Backup | Copying VHDs from backup vault timed out - Please retry the operation in a few minutes. If the problem persists, contact Microsoft Support. | This happens when there is too much data to be copied. Please check if you have less than 16 data disks. |\n| Backup | Could not communicate with the VM agent for snapshot status. Snapshot VM sub task timed out. - Please see the troubleshooting guide on how to resolve this. | This error is thrown if there is a problem with the VM Agent or network access to the Azure infrastructure is blocked in some way. <ul><li>Learn about [debugging VM Agent issues](#vm-agent) <li>Learn about [debugging networking issues](#networking) </ul><br>If the VM agent is not causing any issues, then restart the VM. At times an incorrect VM state can cause issues and restarting the VM resets this \"bad state\" |\n| Backup | Backup failed with an internal error - Please retry the operation in a few minutes. If the problem persists, contact Microsoft Support | You can get this error for 2 reasons: <ol><li> There is too much data to be copied. <li>The original VM has been deleted and therefore backup cannot be taken. In order to keep the backup data for a deleted VM but stop the backup errors, Unprotect the VM and choose the option to keep the data. This will stop the backup schedule and also the recurring error messages. |\n| Backup | Failed to install the Azure Recovery Services extension on the selected item - VM Agent is a pre-requisite for Azure Recovery Services Extension.

This needs to be unique. If you encounter this error, you need to choose a different VM name during restore. <br><br> Note that this error is shown only to users of the Azure portal. The restore operation through PowerShell will succeed because it only restores the disks and doesn't create the VM. The error will be faced when the VM is explicitly created by you after the disk restore operation. |\n| Restore | The specified virtual network configuration is not correct - Please specify a different virtual network configuration and try again. | None |\n| Restore | The specified cloud service is using a reserved IP, which doesn't match with the configuration of the virtual machine being restored - Please specify a different cloud service which is not using reserved IP, or choose another recovery point to restore from. | None |\n| Restore | Cloud service has reached limit on number of input end points - Retry the operation by specifying a different cloud service or by using an existing endpoint. | None |\n| Restore | Backup vault and target storage account are in two different regions - Ensure that the storage account specified in restore operation is in the same Azure region as the backup vault. | None |\n| Restore | Storage Account specified for the restore operation is not supported - Only Basic/Standard storage accounts with locally redundant or geo redundant replication settings are supported. Please select a supported storage account | None |\n| Restore | Type of Storage Account specified for restore operation is not online - Make sure that the storage account specified in restore operation is online | This might happen because of a transient error in Azure Storage or due to an outage.

However, virtual machines that are migrated from on-premises datacenters would not have the VM Agent installed. For such VMs, the VM Agent needs to be installed explicitly. Read more about [installing the VM agent on an existing VM](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mast/archive/2014/04/08/install-the-vm-agent-on-an-existing-azure-vm.aspx).\n\nFor Windows VMs:\n\n- Download and install the [agent MSI](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409). You will need Administrator privileges to complete the installation.\n- [Update the VM property](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mast/archive/2014/04/08/install-the-vm-agent-on-an-existing-azure-vm.aspx) to indicate that the agent is installed.\n\n\n### Updating the VM Agent\nUpdating the VM Agent is as simple as reinstalling the [VM Agent binaries](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409). However, you need to ensure that no backup operation is running while the VM Agent is being updated.\n\n\n### Validating VM Agent installation\nHow to check for the VM Agent version on Windows VMs:\n\n1. Log on to the Azure virtual machine and navigate to the folder *C:\\WindowsAzure\\Packages*. You should find the WaAppAgent.exe file present.\n2. Right-click the file, go to **Properties**, and then select the **Details** tab. The Product Version field should be 2.6.1198.718 or higher\n\n## Networking\nLike all extensions, Backup extension need access to the public internet to work. Not having access to the public internet can manifest itself in a variety of of ways:\n\n- The extension installation can fail\n- The backup operations (like disk snapshot) can fail\n- Displaying the status of the backup operation can fail\n\nThe need for resolving public internet addresses has been articulated [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mast/archive/2014/06/18/azure-vm-provisioning-stuck-on-quot-installing-extensions-on-virtual-machine-quot.aspx). You will need to check the DNS configurations for the VNET and ensure that the Azure URIs can be resolved.\n\nOnce the name resolution is done correctly, access to the Azure IPs also needs to be provided. To unblock access to the Azure infrastructure, follow these steps:\n\n1. Get the list of [Azure datacenter IPs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn175718.aspx) to be whitelisted.\n2. Unblock the IPs using the [New-NetRoute](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh826148.aspx) commandlet. Run this commandlet within the Azure VM, in an elevated PowerShell window (run as Administrator).\n\ntest\n"
