The service is a NoSQL data store that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data.\n\nThe **Add Connected Services** operation installs the appropriate NuGet packages to access Azure storage in your project and adds the connection string for the storage account to your project configuration files.\n\nFor more general information about using Azure Table storage, see [How to use Table storage from .NET](storage-dotnet-how-to-use-tables.md).\n\nTo get started, you first need to create a table in your storage account. We'll show you how to create an Azure table in code. We'll also show you how to perform basic table and entity operations, such as adding, modifying, reading and reading table entities. The samples are written in C\\# code and use the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET.\n\n**NOTE** - Some of the APIs that perform calls out to Azure storage in ASP.NET 5 are asynchronous. See [Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh191443.aspx) for more information. The code below assumes Async programming methods are being used.\n\n## Access tables in code\n\nTo access tables in ASP.NET 5 projects, you need to include the following items to any C# source files that access Azure table storage.\n\n1. Make sure the namespace declarations at the top of the C# file include these `using` statements.\n\n        using Microsoft.Framework.Configuration;\n        using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;\n        using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table;\n        using System.Threading.Tasks;\n        using LogLevel = Microsoft.Framework.Logging.LogLevel;\n\n2. Get a `CloudStorageAccount` object that represents your storage account information. Use the following code to get the your storage connection string and storage account information from the Azure service configuration.\n\n        CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(\n            CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting(\"<storage-account-name>_AzureStorageConnectionString\"));\n\n    **NOTE** - Use all of the above code in front of the code in the following samples.\n\n3. Get a `CloudTableClient` object to reference the table objects in your storage account.  \n\n        // Create the table client.\n        CloudTableClient tableClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudTableClient();\n\n4. Get a `CloudTable` reference object to reference a specific table and entities.\n\n        // Get a reference to a table named \"peopleTable\"\n        CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference(\"peopleTable\");\n\n## Create a table in code\n\nTo create the Azure table, just add a call to `CreateIfNotExistsAsync()`.\n\n    // Create the CloudTable if it does not exist\n    await table.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();\n\n## Add an entity to a table\n\nTo add an entity to a table you create a class that defines the properties of your entity. The following code defines an entity class called **CustomerEntity** that uses the customer's first name as the row key and last name as the partition key.\n\n    public class CustomerEntity : TableEntity\n    {\n        public CustomerEntity(string lastName, string firstName)\n        {\n            this.PartitionKey = lastName;\n            this.RowKey = firstName;\n        }\n\n        public CustomerEntity() { }\n\n        public string Email { get; set; }\n\n        public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }\n    }\n\nTable operations involving entities are done using the `CloudTable` object you created earlier in \"Access tables in code.\" The `TableOperation` object represents the operation to be done. The following code example shows how to create a `CloudTable` object and a `CustomerEntity` object. To prepare the operation, a `TableOperation` is created to insert the customer entity into the table. Finally, the operation is executed by calling CloudTable.ExecuteAsync.\n\n    // Get a reference to the CloudTable object named 'peopleTable' as described in \"Access a table in code\"\n\n    // Create a new customer entity.\n    CustomerEntity customer1 = new CustomerEntity(\"Harp\", \"Walter\");\n    customer1.Email = \"Walter@contoso.com\";\n    customer1.PhoneNumber = \"425-555-0101\";\n\n    // Create the TableOperation that inserts the customer entity.\n    TableOperation insertOperation = TableOperation.Insert(customer1);\n\n    // Execute the insert operation.\n    await peopleTable.ExecuteAsync(insertOperation);\n\n## Insert a batch of entities\n\nYou can insert multiple entities into a table in a single write operation. The following code example creates two entity objects (\"Jeff Smith\" and \"Ben Smith\"), adds them to a `TableBatchOperation` object using the **Insert** method, and then starts the operation by calling CloudTable.ExecuteBatchAsync.\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudTable object named 'peopleTable' as described in \"Access a table in code\"\n\n    // Create the batch operation.\n    TableBatchOperation batchOperation = new TableBatchOperation();\n\n    // Create a customer entity and add it to the table.\n    CustomerEntity customer1 = new CustomerEntity(\"Smith\", \"Jeff\");\n    customer1.Email = \"Jeff@contoso.com\";\n    customer1.PhoneNumber = \"425-555-0104\";\n\n    // Create another customer entity and add it to the table.\n    CustomerEntity customer2 = new CustomerEntity(\"Smith\", \"Ben\");\n    customer2.Email = \"Ben@contoso.com\";\n    customer2.PhoneNumber = \"425-555-0102\";\n\n    // Add both customer entities to the batch insert operation.\n    batchOperation.Insert(customer1);\n    batchOperation.Insert(customer2);\n\n    // Execute the batch operation.\n    await peopleTable.ExecuteBatchAsync(batchOperation);\n\n## Get all of the entities in a partition\nTo query a table for all of the entities in a partition, use a `TableQuery` object. The following code example specifies a filter for entities where 'Smith' is the partition key. This example prints the fields of each entity in the query results to the console.\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudTable object named 'peopleTable' as described in \"Access a table in code\"\n\n    // Construct the query operation for all customer entities where PartitionKey=\"Smith\".\n    TableQuery<CustomerEntity> query = new TableQuery<CustomerEntity>().Where(TableQuery.GenerateFilterCondition(\"PartitionKey\", QueryComparisons.Equal, \"Smith\"));\n\n    // Print the fields for each customer.\n    TableContinuationToken token = null;\n    do\n    {\n        TableQuerySegment<CustomerEntity> resultSegment = await peopleTable.ExecuteQuerySegmentedAsync(query, token);\n        token = resultSegment.ContinuationToken;\n\n        foreach (CustomerEntity entity in resultSegment.Results)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"{0}, {1}\\t{2}\\t{3}\", entity.PartitionKey, entity.RowKey,\n            entity.Email, entity.PhoneNumber);\n        }\n    } while (token != null);\n\n    return View();\n\n\n## Get a single entity\nYou can write a query to get a single, specific entity. The following code uses a `TableOperation` object to specify a customer named 'Ben Smith'. This method returns just one entity, rather than a collection, and the returned value in `TableResult.Result` is a `CustomerEntity` object. Specifying both partition and row keys in a query is the fastest way to retrieve a single entity from the **Table** service.\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudTableobject named 'peopleTable' as described in \"Access a table in code\"\n\n    // Create a retrieve operation that takes a customer entity.\n    TableOperation retrieveOperation = TableOperation.Retrieve<CustomerEntity>(\"Smith\", \"Ben\");\n\n    // Execute the retrieve operation.\n    TableResult retrievedResult = await peopleTable.ExecuteAsync(retrieveOperation);\n\n    // Print the phone number of the result.\n    if (retrievedResult.Result != null)\n       Console.WriteLine(((CustomerEntity)retrievedResult.Result).PhoneNumber);\n    else\n       Console.WriteLine(\"The phone number could not be retrieved.\");\n\n## Delete an entity\nYou can delete an entity after you find it. The following code looks for a customer entity named \"Ben Smith\" and if it finds it, it deletes it.\n\n    // Get a reference to a CloudTableobject named 'peopleTable' as described in \"Access a table in code\"\n\n    // Create a retrieve operation that expects a customer entity.\n    TableOperation retrieveOperation = TableOperation.Retrieve<CustomerEntity>(\"Smith\", \"Ben\");\n\n    // Execute the operation.\n    TableResult retrievedResult = peopleTable.Execute(retrieveOperation);\n\n    // Assign the result to a CustomerEntity object.\n    CustomerEntity deleteEntity = (CustomerEntity)retrievedResult.Result;\n\n    // Create the Delete TableOperation and then execute it.\n    if (deleteEntity != null)\n    {\n       TableOperation deleteOperation = TableOperation.Delete(deleteEntity);\n\n       // Execute the operation.\n       await peopleTable.ExecuteAsync(deleteOperation);\n\n       Console.WriteLine(\"Entity deleted.\");\n    }\n\n    else\n       Console.WriteLine(\"Couldn't delete the entity.\");\n\n## Next steps\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [vs-storage-dotnet-blobs-next-steps](../../includes/vs-storage-dotnet-blobs-next-steps.md)]\n"
