Then, we can use it as an example of how you can use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning with Machine Learning Studio and the Machine Learning web service to create such a predictive analytics solution.  \n\nIn this detailed walkthrough, we'll follow the process of developing a predictive analytics model in Machine Learning Studio and then publishing it as an Azure Machine Learning web service. We'll start with publicly available credit risk data, develop and train a predictive model based on that data, and then publish the model as a web service that can be used by others for credit risk assessment.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-free-trial](../../includes/machine-learning-free-trial.md)]\n\nOpen Machine Learning Studio: [https://studio.azureml.net/Home](https://studio.azureml.net/Home). For more information about getting started with Machine Learning Studio, see [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio Home](https://studio.azureml.net/).\n\nTo create a credit risk assessment solution, we'll follow these steps:  \n\n1.  [Create a Machine Learning workspace](machine-learning-walkthrough-1-create-ml-workspace.md)\n2.  [Upload existing data](machine-learning-walkthrough-2-upload-data.md)\n3.  [Create a new experiment](machine-learning-walkthrough-3-create-new-experiment.md)\n4.  [Train and evaluate the models](machine-learning-walkthrough-4-train-and-evaluate-models.md)\n5.  [Publish the web service](machine-learning-walkthrough-5-publish-web-service.md)\n6.  [Access the web service](machine-learning-walkthrough-6-access-web-service.md)\n\nThis walkthrough is based on a simplified version of the\n[Credit risk prediction sample experiment](../machine-learning-sample-credit-risk-prediction.md) included with Machine Learning Studio.\n \ntest\n"
