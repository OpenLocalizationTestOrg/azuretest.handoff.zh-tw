The retry logic is designed to gracefully process temporary errors or *transient faults* that tend to go away if the program waits a few seconds and retries.\n\n\nADO.NET classes that you use to connect to your local Microsoft SQL Server can also connect to Azure SQL Database.\nHowever, by themselves the ADO.NET classes cannot provide all the robustness and reliability necessary in production use.\nYour client program can encounter transient faults from which it should silently and gracefully recover on its own. A couple examples of transient faults:\n\n\n- A connection over the Internet is subject to brief network outages, after which the connection can be recreated.\n\n- Cloud computing involves load balancing which can briefly block attempts to connect or query.\n\n\n## Identify transient errors\n\n\nYour program must distinguish between transient errors versus persistent errors.\nIf you program has a misspelling of the target database name, the \"No such database found\" error will persist and will reoccur every time you rerun the program.\n\n\nThe list of error numbers that are categorized as transient faults is available at:\n\n\n- [Error messages for SQL Database client programs](sql-database-develop-error-messages.md#bkmk_connection_errors)\n - See the section about *Transient Errors, Connection-Loss Errors*.\n\n\n## C# code sample\n\n\nThe C# code sample in the present topic contains custom detection and retry logic to handle transient errors.\n\n\nThe code sample follows a few basic guidelines or recommendations that apply regardless of which technology you use to interact with Azure SQL Database.\nYou can see the general recommendations at:\n\n\n- [Connecting to SQL Database: Links, Best Practices and Design Guidelines](sql-database-connect-central-recommendations.md)\n\n\nThe C# code sample consists of the two .cs files whose content is pasted into the sections that follow.  Their file names are:\n\n\n- `Program.cs`\n- `Custom_SqlDatabaseTransientErrorDetectionStrategy.cs`\n\n\n## Compile and run the code sample\n\n\nYou can compile the sample with the following steps:\n\n\n1. In Visual Studio, create a new project from the C# Console Application template.\n\n2. Right-click your project, and then add the .cs for which source code is provided in this topic.\n\n3. In a `cmd.exe` command window, run the program as shown next.
