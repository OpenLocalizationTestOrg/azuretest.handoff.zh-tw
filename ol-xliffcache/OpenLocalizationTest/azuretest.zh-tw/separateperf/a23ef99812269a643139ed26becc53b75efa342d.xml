Furthermore, you can build applications comprised of components built using a mix of languages, frameworks, and operating systems.\n\nThis how-to guide explains how to use the Service Bus brokered messaging features (queues and publish/subscribe topics) from Java applications using the popular Java Message Service (JMS) API standard. There is a companion How-to guide that explains how to do the same using the Service Bus .NET API. You can use these two guides together to learn about cross-platform messaging using AMQP 1.0.\n\n## Get started with Service Bus\n\nThis guide assumes that you already have a Service Bus namespace containing a queue named \"queue1.\" If you do not, then you can create the namespace and queue using the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com). For more information about how to create Service Bus namespaces and queues, see [How to Use Service Bus Queues](service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-queues.md).\n\n**Note**: You must create the queue with partitioning disabled as partitioned queues and topics do not yet have AMQP support. For additional information, see [Partitioning Messaging Entities](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn520246.aspx).\n\n## Downloading the AMQP 1.0 JMS client library\n\nFor information about where to download the latest version of the Apache Qpid JMS AMQP 1.0 client library, visit [http://people.apache.org/~rgodfrey/qpid-java-amqp-1-0-client-jms.html](http://people.apache.org/~rgodfrey/qpid-java-amqp-1-0-client-jms.html).\n\nYou must add the following four JAR files from the Apache Qpid JMS AMQP 1.0 distribution archive to the Java CLASSPATH when building and running JMS applications with Service Bus:\n\n*    geronimo-jms\\_1.1\\_spec-1.0.jar\n*    qpid-amqp-1-0-client-[version].jar\n*    qpid-amqp-1-0-client-jms-[version].jar\n*    qpid-amqp-1-0-common-[version].jar\n\n## Coding Java applications\n\n### Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)\n\nJMS uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) to create a separation between logical names and physical names. Two types of JMS objects are resolved using JNDI: ConnectionFactory and Destination. JNDI uses a provider model into which you can plug different directory services to handle name resolution duties. The Apache Qpid JMS AMQP 1.0 library comes with a simple properties file-based JNDI Provider that is configured using a properties file of the following format:\n\n```\n# servicebus.properties - sample JNDI configuration\n    \n# Register a ConnectionFactory in JNDI using the form:\n# connectionfactory.[jndi_name] = [ConnectionURL]\nconnectionfactory.SBCF = amqps://[username]:[password]@[namespace].servicebus.windows.net\n    \n# Register some queues in JNDI using the form\n# queue.[jndi_name] = [physical_name]\n# topic.[jndi_name] = [physical_name]\nqueue.QUEUE = queue1\n```\n\n#### Configuring the ConnectionFactory\n\nThe entry used to define a **ConnectionFactory** in the Qpid Properties File JNDI Provider is of the following format:\n\n```\nconnectionfactory.[jndi_name] = [ConnectionURL]\n```\n\nWhere **[jndi_name]** and **[ConnectionURL]** have the following meanings:\n\n- **[jndi_name]**: The logical name of the ConnectionFactory. This is the name that will be resolved in the Java application using the JNDI IntialContext.lookup() method.\n- **[ConnectionURL]**: A URL that provides the JMS library with the information required to the AMQP broker.\n\nThe format of the **ConnectionURL** is as follows:\n\n```\namqps://[username]:[password]@[namespace].servicebus.windows.net\n```\nWhere **[namespace]**, **[username]** and **[password]** have the following meanings:\n\n- **[namespace]**: The Service Bus namespace.\n- **[username]**: The Service Bus issuer name.\n- **[password]**: URL-encoded form of the Service Bus issuer key.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] You must URL-encode the password manually. A useful URL-encoding utility is available at [http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp).\n\n#### Configuring Destinations\n\nThe entry used to define a destination in the Qpid Properties File JNDI Provider is of the following format:\n\n```\nqueue.[jndi_name] = [physical_name]\n```\n\nor\n\n```\ntopic.[jndi_name] = [physical_name]\n```\n\nWhere **[jndi\\_name]** and **[physical\\_name]** have the following meanings:\n\n- **[jndi_name]**: The logical name of the destination. This is the name that will be resolved in the Java application using the JNDI IntialContext.lookup() method.\n- **[physical_name]**: The name of the Service Bus entity to which the application sends or receives messages.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] When receiving from a Service Bus topic subscription, the physical name specified in JNDI should be the name of the topic. The subscription name is provided when the durable subscription is created in the JMS application code. The [Service Bus AMQP 1.0 Developer's Guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj841071.aspx) provides more details on working with Service Bus topic subscriptions from JMS.\n\n### Writing the JMS application\n\nThere are no special APIs or options required when using JMS with Service Bus. However, there are a few restrictions that will be covered later. As with any JMS application, the first thing required is configuration of the JNDI environment, to be able to resolve a **ConnectionFactory** and destinations.\n\n#### Configuring the JNDI InitialContext\n\nThe JNDI environment is configured by passing a hashtable of configuration information into the constructor of the javax.naming.InitialContext class. The two required elements in the hashtable are the class name of the Initial Context Factory and the Provider URL. The following code shows how to configure the JNDI environment to use the Qpid properties file based JNDI Provider with a properties file named **servicebus.properties**.\n\n```\nHashtable<String, String> env = new Hashtable<String, String>(); \nenv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, \"org.apache.qpid.amqp_1_0.jms.jndi.PropertiesFileInitialContextFactory\"); \nenv.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, \"servicebus.properties\"); \nInitialContext context = new InitialContext(env);\n``` \n\n### A simple JMS application using a Service Bus queue\n\nThe following example program sends JMS TextMessages to a Service Bus queue with the JNDI logical name of QUEUE, and receives the messages back.\n\n    // SimpleSenderReceiver.java\n    \n    import javax.jms.*;\n    import javax.naming.Context;\n    import javax.naming.InitialContext;\n    import java.io.BufferedReader;\n    import java.io.InputStreamReader;\n    import java.util.Hashtable;\n    import java.util.Random;\n    \n    public class SimpleSenderReceiver implements MessageListener {\n        private static boolean runReceiver = true;\n        private Connection connection;\n        private Session sendSession;\n        private Session receiveSession;\n        private MessageProducer sender;\n        private MessageConsumer receiver;\n        private static Random randomGenerator = new Random();\n    \n        public SimpleSenderReceiver() throws Exception {\n            // Configure JNDI environment\n            Hashtable<String, String> env = new Hashtable<String, String>();\n            env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, \n                    \"org.apache.qpid.amqp_1_0.jms.jndi.PropertiesFileInitialContextFactory\");\n            env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, \"servicebus.properties\");\n            Context context = new InitialContext(env);\n    \n            // Lookup ConnectionFactory and Queue\n            ConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory) context.lookup(\"SBCF\");\n            Destination queue = (Destination) context.lookup(\"QUEUE\");\n    \n            // Create Connection\n            connection = cf.createConnection();\n    \n            // Create sender-side Session and MessageProducer\n            sendSession = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n            sender = sendSession.createProducer(queue);\n    \n            if (runReceiver) {\n                // Create receiver-side Session, MessageConsumer,and MessageListener\n                receiveSession = connection.createSession(false, Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n                receiver = receiveSession.createConsumer(queue);\n                receiver.setMessageListener(this);\n                connection.start();\n            }\n        }\n    \n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n            try {\n    \n                if ((args.length > 0) && args[0].equalsIgnoreCase(\"sendonly\")) {\n                    runReceiver = false;\n                }\n    \n                SimpleSenderReceiver simpleSenderReceiver = new SimpleSenderReceiver();\n                System.out.println(\"Press [enter] to send a message. Type 'exit' + [enter] to quit.\");\n                BufferedReader commandLine = new java.io.BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n    \n                while (true) {\n                    String s = commandLine.readLine();\n                    if (s.equalsIgnoreCase(\"exit\")) {\n                        simpleSenderReceiver.close();\n                        System.exit(0);\n                    } else {\n                        simpleSenderReceiver.sendMessage();\n                    }\n                }\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    \n        private void sendMessage() throws JMSException {\n            TextMessage message = sendSession.createTextMessage();\n            message.setText(\"Test AMQP message from JMS\");\n            long randomMessageID = randomGenerator.nextLong() >>>1;\n            message.setJMSMessageID(\"ID:\" + randomMessageID);\n            sender.send(message);\n            System.out.println(\"Sent message with JMSMessageID = \" + message.getJMSMessageID());\n        }\n    \n        public void close() throws JMSException {\n            connection.close();\n        }\n    \n        public void onMessage(Message message) {\n            try {\n                System.out.println(\"Received message with JMSMessageID = \" + message.getJMSMessageID());\n                message.acknowledge();\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }   \n\n### Running the application\n\nRunning the application produces output of the form:\n\n```\n> java SimpleSenderReceiver\nPress [enter] to send a message. Type 'exit' + [enter] to quit.\n    \nSent message with JMSMessageID = ID:2867600614942270318\nReceived message with JMSMessageID = ID:2867600614942270318\n    \nSent message with JMSMessageID = ID:7578408152750301483\nReceived message with JMSMessageID = ID:7578408152750301483\n    \nSent message with JMSMessageID = ID:956102171969368961\nReceived message with JMSMessageID = ID:956102171969368961\nexit\n```\n\n## Cross-platform messaging between JMS and .NET\n\nThis guide showed how to send and receive messages to and from Service Bus using JMS. However, one of the key benefits of AMQP 1.0 is that it enables applications to be built from components written in different languages, with messages exchanged reliably and at full fidelity.\n\nUsing the sample JMS application described above and a similar .NET application taken from a companion guide, [How to use AMQP 1.0 with the .NET Service Bus .NET API](service-bus-dotnet-advanced-message-queuing.md), you can exchange messages between .NET and Java. \n\nFor more information about the details of cross-platform messaging using Service Bus and AMQP 1.0, see the [Service Bus AMQP 1.0 Developer's Guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj841071.aspx).\n\n### JMS to .NET\n\nTo demonstrate JMS to .NET messaging:\n\n* Start the .NET sample application without any command-line arguments.\n* Start the Java sample application with the \"sendonly\" command-line argument. In this mode, the application will not receive messages from the queue, it will only send.\n* Press **Enter** a few times in the Java application console, which will cause messages to be sent.\n* These messages are received by the .NET application.\n\n#### Output from JMS application\n\n```\n> java SimpleSenderReceiver sendonly\nPress [enter] to send a message. Type 'exit' + [enter] to quit.\nSent message with JMSMessageID = ID:4364096528752411591\nSent message with JMSMessageID = ID:459252991689389983\nSent message with JMSMessageID = ID:1565011046230456854\nexit\n```\n\n#### Output from .NET application\n\n```\n> SimpleSenderReceiver.exe  \nPress [enter] to send a message. Type 'exit' + [enter] to quit.\nReceived message with MessageID = 4364096528752411591\nReceived message with MessageID = 459252991689389983\nReceived message with MessageID = 1565011046230456854\nexit\n```\n\n### .NET to JMS\n\nTo demonstrate .NET to JMS messaging:\n\n* Start the .NET sample application with the \"sendonly\" command-line argument. In this mode, the application will not receive messages from the queue, it will only send.\n* Start the Java sample application without any command-line arguments.\n* Press **Enter** a few times in the .NET application console, which will cause messages to be sent.\n* These messages are received by the Java application.\n\n#### Output from .NET application\n\n```\n> SimpleSenderReceiver.exe sendonly\nPress [enter] to send a message.

If you need to create multiple **MessageProducers** or **MessageConsumers** in an application, create a dedicated **Session** for each of them.\n* Volatile topic subscriptions are not currently supported.\n* **MessageSelectors** are not currently supported.\n* Temporary destinations, i.e., **TemporaryQueue**, **TemporaryTopic** are not currently supported, along with the **QueueRequestor** and **TopicRequestor** APIs that use them.\n* Transacted sessions and distributed transactions are not supported.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis how-to guide showed how to use Service Bus brokered messaging features (queues and publish/subscribe topics) from Java using the popular JMS API and AMQP 1.0.\n\nYou can also use Service Bus AMQP 1.0 from other languages, including .NET, C, Python, and PHP. Components built using these different languages can exchange messages reliably and at full fidelity using the AMQP 1.0 support in Service Bus.
