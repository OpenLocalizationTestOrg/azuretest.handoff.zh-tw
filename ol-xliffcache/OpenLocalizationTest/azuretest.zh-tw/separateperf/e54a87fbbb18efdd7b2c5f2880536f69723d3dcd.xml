The StorSimple 8100 device has a single primary enclosure.\n\nThe installation consists of multiple steps, each of which is discussed in the following procedures. \n\n### Prepare the site\n\nThe device must be installed in a standard 19-inch rack that has both front and rear posts. Use the following procedure to prepare for rack installation.\n\n#### To prepare the site for rack installation\n\n1. Make sure that the device rests safely on a flat, stable, and level work surface (or similar).\n\n2. Verify that the site where you intend to set up has standard AC power from an independent source or a rack power distribution unit (PDU) with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).\n\n3. Make sure that one 2U slot is available on the rack in which you intend to mount the device. \n\n>[AZURE.WARNING]\n> ![heavy weight icon](./media/storsimple-8100-hardware-installation/HCS_HeavyWeight_Icon.png)\n> \n> Make sure that you have two people available to manage the weight if you are handling the device setup manually. A fully configured enclosure can weigh up to 32 kg (70 lbs.).\n\n### Rack prerequisites\n\nThe 8100 enclosure is designed for installation in a standard 19-inch rack cabinet with: \n\n- Minimum depth of 27.84 inches from rack post to post.\n- Maximum weight of 32 kg for the device\n- Maximum back pressure of 5 Pascal (0.5 mm water gauge).\n\n### Rack-mounting rail kit\n\nA set of mounting rails is provided for use with the 19-inch rack cabinet. The rails have been tested to handle the maximum enclosure weight. These rails will also allow installation of multiple enclosures without any loss of space within the rack.\n\n#### To install the device on the rails\n\n1. With the enclosure on the work surface, remove the left and right front flange caps by pulling the caps free. The flange caps simply snap onto the flanges.\n\n2. Typically, the rails are installed at the factory. If they are not, then install the left-rail and right-rail slides to the sides of the enclosure chassis. They attach using six metric screws on each side. To help with orientation, the rail slides are marked **LH – Front** and **RH – Front**, and the end that is affixed towards the rear of the enclosure has a tapered end.<br/>\n\n    ![Attaching rail slides to enclosure chassis](./media/storsimple-8100-hardware-installation/HCSAttachingRailSlidestoEnclosureChassis.png) \n\n   **Attaching rail slides to the sides of the enclosure**\n\n    Label | Description\n    ----- | -----------\n    1     | M 3x4 button-head screws\n    2     | Chassis slides\n\n3. Attach the left rail and right rail assemblies to the rack cabinet vertical members. The brackets are marked **LH**, **RH**, and **This side up** to guide you through the correct orientation.\n\n4. Locate the rail pins at the front and rear of the rail assembly. Extend the rail to fit between the rack posts and insert the pins into the front and rear rack post vertical member holes. Be sure that the rail assembly is level.\n\n5. Use two of the provided metric screws to secure the rail assembly to the rack vertical members. Use one screw on the front and one on the rear.\n\n6. Repeat these steps for the other rail assembly.<br/>\n\n     ![Attaching rail slides to rack cabinet](./media/storsimple-8100-hardware-installation/HCSAttachingRailSlidestoRackCabinet.png) \n\n    **Attaching rail assemblies to the rack**\n\n     Label | Description\n     ----- | -----------\n     1     | Clamping screw\n     2     | Square-hole front rack post screw\n     3     | Left front-rail location pins\n     4     | Clamping screw\n     5     | Right front-rail location pins\n\n### Mounting the device in the rack\n\nUsing the rack rails that were just installed, perform the following steps to mount the device in the rack. \n\n#### To mount the device\n\n1. With an assistant, lift the enclosure and align it with the rack rails. \n\n2. Carefully insert the device into the rails, and then push the device completely into the rack cabinet.<br/>\n\n    ![Inserting device in the rack](./media/storsimple-8100-hardware-installation/HCSInsertingDeviceintheRack.png)\n\n    **Mounting the device in the rack**\n\n3. Secure the enclosure in the rack by installing one provided Phillips-head screw through each flange, left and right.\n\n4. Install the flange caps by pressing them into position and snapping them in place.<br/>\n\n     ![Installing flange caps](./media/storsimple-8100-hardware-installation/HCSInstallingFlangeCaps.png)\n \n    **Installing the flange caps**\n\n     Label | Description\n     ----- | -----------\n     1     | Enclosure fastening screw\n\nThe next step is to cable your device for power, network, and serial access. \n\n## Cable your StorSimple 8100 device\n\nThe following procedures explain how to cable your StorSimple 8100 device for power, network, and serial connections. \n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin the cabling of your device, you will need:\n\n- Your storage device, completely unpacked\n\n- 2 power cables that came with your device\n\n- Access to 2 Power Distribution Units (recommended).\n\n- Network cables\n\n- Provided serial cables\n\n- Serial USB converter with the appropriate driver installed on your PC (if needed)\n\n- Provided single QSFP-to-SFP+ adapters for use with 10 GbE network interfaces\n\n- [Supported hardware for 10 GbE network interfaces on your StorSimple device](storsimple-supported-hardware-for-10-gbe-network-interfaces.md)\n\n\n### Power cabling\n\nYour device includes redundant Power and Cooling Modules (PCMs). Both PCMs must be installed and connected to different power sources to ensure high availability.\n\nPerform the following steps to cable your device for power.\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [storsimple-cable-8100-for-power](../../includes/storsimple-cable-8100-for-power.md)]\n\n### Network cabling\n\nYour device is an active-standby configuration: at any given time, one controller module is active and processing all disk and network operations while the other controller module is on standby. If a controller fails, the standby controller is activated immediately and continues all the disk and networking operations. \n\nTo support this redundant controller failover, you need to cable your device network as described in the following steps.\n\n#### To cable for network connection\n\n1. Your device has six network interfaces on each controller: four 1 Gbps, and two 10 Gbps Ethernet ports. Identify the various data ports on the backplane of your device.\n\n    ![Backplane of 8100 device](./media/storsimple-8100-hardware-installation/HCSBackplaneof2UDevicewithPortsLabeled.jpg)\n\n    **Back of the device showing data ports**\n \n     Label   | Description\n     ------- | -----------\n     0,1,4,5 |  1 GbE network interfaces\n     2,3     | 10 GbE network interfaces\n     6       | Serial ports\n\n2. For high availability, the device requires a minimum of two connections for each controller.\n    1. The DATA 0 port is automatically enabled and configured via the serial console of the device. Apart from DATA 0, another data port also needs to be configured through the Management Portal. \n    2. Identify identical network interfaces on each controller. For instance, if you choose to connect DATA 0 and DATA 3 for one of the controllers, you need to connect the corresponding DATA 0 and DATA 3 on the other controller. \n\n3. For high availability, ensure that you connect:\n    1. Identical interfaces on each controller to the relevant network to ensure availability if a controller failure occurs.\n    2. Interfaces from each controller to at least two different switches to ensure availability if a switch failure occurs.\n    3. DATA 0 port to the primary LAN (network with Internet access). The other data ports can be connected to SAN/iSCSI LAN (VLAN) segment of the network, depending on the intended role.\n\n    At a minimum, configure one network interface for cloud access and one for iSCSI. For high availability and performance, configure two pairs of network interfaces on each controller. See the following diagram for network cabling. (The minimum network configuration is shown by solid blue lines. For high availability and performance, additional configuration required is shown by dotted lines.)\n\n    ![Cable your 2U device for network](./media/storsimple-8100-hardware-installation/HCSCableYour2UDeviceforNetwork.png)\n\n    **Network cabling for your device**\n\n    Label | Description\n    ----- | -----------\n     A    | LAN with Internet access\n     B    | Controller 0\n     C    | PCM 0\n     D    | Controller 1\n     E    | PCM 1\n     F,G  | Hosts\n     0-5  | Network interfaces\n   \n### Serial port cabling\n\nPerform the following steps to cable your serial port.\n\n#### To cable for serial connection\n\n1. Your device has a serial port on each controller that is identified by a wrench icon. Refer to the illustration in the [Network cabling](#network-cabling) section to locate the serial ports on the backplane of your device. \n\n2. Identify the active controller on your device backplane. A blinking blue LED indicates that the controller is active. \n\n3. Use the provided serial cables (if needed, the USB-serial converter for your laptop), and connect your console or computer (with terminal emulation to the device) to the serial port of the active controller.\n\n4. Install the serial-USB drivers (shipped with the device) on your computer.\n\n5. Set up the serial connection as follows: 115,200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and flow control set to None.\n\n6. Verify that the connection is working by pressing Enter on the console. A serial console menu should appear.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] **Lights-Out Management**: When the device is installed in a remote datacenter or in a computer room with limited access, ensure that the serial connections to both controllers are always connected to a serial console switch or similar equipment. This allows out-of-band remote control and support operations if there are network disruptions or unexpected failures.\n\nYour device is now cabled for power, network access, and serial connectivity. The next step is to configure the software on your device.\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou are now ready to [deploy and configure your on-premises StorSimple device](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md) \n \n"
