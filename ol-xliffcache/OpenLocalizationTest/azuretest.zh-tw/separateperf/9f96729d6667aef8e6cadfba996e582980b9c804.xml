Resource Manager takes advantage of role-based access control (RBAC) so you can easily apply security policies to individual resources or resource groups. For example, you can grant a user access to a specific virtual machine in a subscription, or give a user the ability to manage all websites in a subscription but no other resources.\n\n## Concepts\n\nThere are a few key concepts about role-based access control for you to understand:\n\n1. Principal - the entity granted permission, such as a user, security group, or application.\n2. Role - set of permitted actions\n3. Scope - the level a role applies to, such as the subscription, resource group, or resource.\n3. Role Assignment - the process of adding a principal to a role and setting the scope.\n\n## Role examples\nTo understand RBAC concepts, let's look at some examples of common role definitions:\n\n| Role    | Allowed actions |\n| ------- | ----------------- |\n| Reader  | */read  (Read anything) |\n| Owner   | *       (Read/write anything) |\n\nTo assign the **Reader** role to **User A** for resource group named **ExampleGroup**, and the **Owner** role to **User B** for the whole subscription, you would assign the following:\n\n| Role    | Principal   | Scope |\n| --------|-------------|---------- |\n| Reader  | User A      | /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/examplegroup |\n| Owner   | User B      | /subscriptions/{subscriptionId} |\n\n## Example Scenarios\n\nIn this topic, you will see how to perform the following common scenarios through Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI for Mac, Linux and Windows, and REST API.\n\n1. View the available roles in a subscription and the permitted actions for those roles.\n2. Grant Reader permissions to members of a group across the subscription.\n3. Grant Contributor permissions to an application to allow the application to manage resources inside the resource group.\n4. Grant Owner permissions on a particular website to a single user.\n5. List auditing logs of resource group.\n\n\n## How to use PowerShell to manage access\nIf you do not already have the latest version of Azure PowerShell installed, see [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md). Open the Azure PowerShell console. \n\n1. Login to your Azure account with your credentials. The command returns information about your account.\n\n        PS C:\\> Add-AzureAccount\n          \n        Id                             Type       ...\n        --                             ----    \n        someone@example.com            User       ...   \n\n2. If you have multiple subscriptions, provide the subscription id you wish to use for deployment. \n\n        PS C:\\> Select-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionID <YourSubscriptionId>\n\n3. Switch to the Azure Resource Manager module.\n\n        PS C:\\> Switch-AzureMode AzureResourceManager\n\n### View available roles\nTo view all available roles for your subscription run the **Get-AzureRoleDefinition** command.\n\n    PS C:\\> Get-AzureRoleDefinition\n\n    Name                          Id                            Actions                  NotActions\n    ----                          --                            -------                  ----------\n    API Management Service Con... /subscriptions/####... {Microsoft.ApiManagement/S...   {}\n    Application Insights Compo... /subscriptions/####... {Microsoft.Insights/compon...   {}\n    ...\n\n### Grant Reader permission to a group for the subscription.\n1. Review the **Reader** role definition by providing the role name when running the **Get-AzureRoleDefinition** command. Check that the allowed actions are what you intend to assign.\n\n        PS C:\\> Get-AzureRoleDefinition Reader\n   \n        Name            Id                            Actions           NotActions\n        ----            --                            -------           ----------\n        Reader          /subscriptions/####...        {*/read}          {}\n\n2. Get the required security group by running the **Get-AzureADGroup** command. Provide the actual name of the group in your subscription. ExampleAuditorGroup is shown below.\n\n        PS C:\\> $group = Get-AzureAdGroup -SearchString ExampleAuditorGroup\n\n3. Create the role assignment for the auditor security group. When the command completes, the new role assignment is returned.\n\n        PS C:\\> New-AzureRoleAssignment -ObjectId $group.Id -Scope /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/ -RoleDefinitionName Reader\n\n        Mail               :\n        RoleAssignmentId   : /subscriptions/####/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/####\n        DisplayName        : Auditors\n        RoleDefinitionName : Reader\n        Actions            : {*/read}\n        NotActions         : {}\n        Scope              : /subscriptions/####\n        ObjectId           : ####\n\n###Grant Contributor permission to an application for a resource group.\n1. Review the **Contributor** role definition by providing the role name when running the **Get-AzureRoleDefinition** command. Check that the allowed actions are what you intend to assign.\n\n        PS C:\\> Get-AzureRoleDefinition Contributor\n\n2. Get the service principal object Id by running the **Get-AzureADServicePrincipal** command and providing the name of the application in your subscription. ExampleApplication is shown below.\n\n        PS C:\\> $service = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -SearchString ExampleApplicationName\n\n3. Create the role assignments for the service principal by running the **New-AzureRoleAssignment** command.\n\n        PS C:\\> New-AzureRoleAssignment -ObjectId $service.Id -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroupName -RoleDefinitionName Contributor\n\nFor a more thorough explanation of setting up an Azure Active Directory application and a service principal, see [Authenticating a Service Principal with Azure Resource Manager](../resource-group-authenticate-service-principal.md).\n\n###Grant Owner permissions to a user for a resource.\n1. Review the **Owner** role definition by providing the role name when running the **Get-AzureRoleDefinition** command. Check that the allowed actions are what you intend to assign.\n\n        PS C:\\> Get-AzureRoleDefinition Owner\n\n2. Create the role assignments for the user.\n\n        PS C:\\> New-AzureRoleAssignment -UserPrincipalName \"someone@example.com\" -ResourceGroupName {groupName} -ResourceType \"Microsoft.Web/sites\" -ResourceName \"mysite\" -RoleDefinitionName Owner\n\n\n###List auditing logs of resource group.\nTo get the auditing log for a resource group, run the **Get-AzureResourceGroupLog** command.\n\n      PS C:\\> Get-AzureResourceGroupLog -ResourceGroup ExampleGroupName\n\n## How to use Azure CLI for Mac, Linux and Windows\n\nIf you do not have Azure CLI for Mac, Linux and Windows installed or you have not configured your organizational account for use with Azure CLI, see [Install and Configure the Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md).\n\n1. Login to your Azure account with your credentials. The command returns the result of your login.\n\n        azure login\n\n        ...\n        info:    login command OK\n\n2. If you have multiple subscriptions, provide the subscription id you wish to use for deployment.\n\n        azure account set <YourSubscriptionNameOrId>\n\n3. Switch to Azure Resource Manager module. You will receive confirmation of the new mode.\n\n        azure config mode arm\n        \n        info:     New mode is arm\n\n### View available roles\nView all available roles for your subscription. It returns a list of role definitions.\n\n    azure role list\n\n### Grant Reader permission to a group for the subscription.\n1. Get the role definition for the **Reader** role. Check that the allowed actions are what you intend to assign.\n\n        azure role show Reader\n        \n        info:    Executing command role show\n        + Getting role definitions\n        data:    Name    Actions  NotActions\n        data:    ------  -------  ----------\n        data:    Reader  */read\n        info:    role show command OK\n\n2. Get the required security group and its objectId by searching for the group based on the name. ExampleAuditorGroup is shown in the following example.\n\n        azure ad group show --search ExampleAuditorGroup\n        \n        info:    Executing command ad group show\n        + Getting group list\n        data:    Display Name:      ExampleAuditorGroup\n        data:    ObjectId:          1c272299-9729-462a-8d52-7efe5ece0c5c\n        data:    Security Enabled:  true\n        data:    Mail Enabled:\n        data:\n        info:    ad group show command OK\n\n3. Create the role assignment for the security group.\n\n        azure role assignment create --objectId {group-object-id} -o Reader -c /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/\n        \n        info:    Executing command role assignment create\n        + Getting role definition id\n        + Creating role assignment\n        info:    role assignment create command OK\n\n\n### Grant Contributor permission to an application for a resource group.\n1.
