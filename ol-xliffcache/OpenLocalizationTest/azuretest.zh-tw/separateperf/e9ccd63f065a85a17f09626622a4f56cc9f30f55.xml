This means that you can focus on your business needs and let Service Fabric take care of ensuring your application is always available and scales.\n\n## Key concepts\n\n**Cluster** - A network connected set of virtual or physical machines into which application instances are deployed.  Clusters can scale to thousands of machines.\n\n**Node** - An addressable unit in a cluster. Nodes have characteristics such as placement properties and unique IDs. Nodes can join a cluster and correlate to an operating system instance with Fabric.exe running.\n\n**Application / Application Type** - A collection of (micro)services. Think of an application type as a container for one or more service types.  Please refer to the [Application Model](service-fabric-application-model.md) article to understand how a cluster (which itself consists of multiple nodes) may consist of multiple ApplicationTypes.\n\n**Service / Service Type** - Code and configuration that performs a standalone function (it can start and run independently), for example, a queue service or database service. An ApplicationType may consist of one ore more ServiceTypes. There are two kinds of services types:\n\n- Stateless service: A service that has state where the state is persisted to external storage, such as Azure Databases or Azure Table store. If a node on which an instance of this service is active goes down, another instance is automatically started on another node.\n\n- Stateful service: A service that has state and achieves reliability through replication between replicas on other nodes in the cluster. Stateful services have a primary and multiple secondary replicas. If a node on which a replica of this service is active goes down, a new replica is started on another node and if this was the primary replica, a secondary replica is automatically promoted to a new primary.\n\n**Application Instance** - In a cluster you can create many application instances of an application type, each of which has a specific name. Each application instance can be independently managed and versioned from other application instances of the same type or different type. Additionally they define resource and security isolation.\n\n**Service Instance** -  Code that has been instantiated for a service type. Each service instance has a unique name starting with `fabric:/` and is associated with an particular named application instance.\n\n**Application Package** - The collection of service code packages and the configuration files combined for a particular application. These are the physical files that are deployed and is simply a file and folder format layout. For example, an application package for an email application could contain a queue service package, a frontend service package, and a database service package.\n\n**Programming Models** - There are two programming models available in Service Fabric to build applications:\n\n- Reliable Services - An API to build stateless and stateful services based on `StatelessService` and `StatefulService` .NET classes, storing state in .NET reliable collections (Dictionary and Queue) and with the ability to plug in a variety of communication stacks such as Web API and WCF. This programming model is suitable for applications where you need to perform compute across multiple units of state.\n\n- Reliable Actors - An API to build stateless and stateful objects through the virtual Actor programming model which is suitable for applications with multiple independent units of state and compute.\n\n<!--Every topic should have next steps and links to the next logical set of content to keep the customer engaged-->\n## Next steps\nTo learn more about Service Fabric, see:\n\n- [Application Model](service-fabric-application-model.md)\n- [Application Scenarios](service-fabric-application-scenarios.md)\n "
