You can use any means you want when creating these requests as long as you specify the correct header values and pass in the access token correctly when calling into Media Services.\n\nThe following steps describe the most common workflow when using the Media Services REST API to connect to Media Services:\n\n1. Getting an access token \n2. Connecting to the Media Services URI \n\n    >[AZURE.NOTE] After successfully connecting to https://media.windows.net, you will receive a 301 redirect specifying another Media Services URI. You must make subsequent calls to the new URI.\n    You may also receive a HTTP/1.1 200 response that contains the ODATA API metadata description.\n\n3. Post your subsequent API calls to the new URL. \n\n    For example, if after trying to connect, you got the following:\n\n        HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n        Location: https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/\n\n    You should post your subsequent API calls to https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/.\n\n##Getting an access token\n\nTo access Media Services directly through the REST API, retrieve an access token from ACS and use it during every HTTP request you make into the service. This token is similar to other tokens provided by ACS based on access claims provided in the header of an HTTP request and using the OAuth v2 protocol. You do not need any other prerequisites before directly connecting to Media Services.\n\nThe following example shows the HTTP request header and body used to retrieve a token.\n\n**Header**:\n\n    POST https://wamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net/v2/OAuth2-13 HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    Host: wamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net\n    Content-Length: 120\n    Expect: 100-continue\n    Connection: Keep-Alive\n    Accept: application/json\n\n    \n**Body**:\n\nYou need to prove the client_id and client_secret values in the body of this request; client_id and client_secret correspond to the AccountName and AccountKey values, respectively. These values are provided to you by Media Services when you set up your account. \n\nNote that the AccountKey for your Media Services account must be URL-encoded (see [Percent-Encoding](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1) when using it as the client_secret value in your access token request.\n\n    grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=ams_account_name&client_secret=URL_encoded_ams_account_key&scope=urn%3aWindowsAzureMediaServices\n\n\nFor example: \n\n    grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=amstestaccount001&client_secret=wUNbKhNj07oqjqU3Ah9R9f4kqTJ9avPpfe6Pk3YZ7ng%3d&scope=urn%3aWindowsAzureMediaServices\n\n\nThe following example shows the HTTP response that contains the access token in the response body.\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store\n    Pragma: no-cache\n    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n    Expires: -1\n    request-id: a65150f5-2784-4a01-a4b7-33456187ad83\n    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\n    Date: Thu, 15 Jan 2015 08:07:20 GMT\n    Content-Length: 670\n    \n    {  \n       \"token_type\":\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2009/11/swt-token-profile-1.0\",\n       \"access_token\":\"http%3a%2f%2fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2fws%2f2005%2f05%2fidentity%2fclaims%2fnameidentifier=amstestaccount001&urn%3aSubscriptionId=z7f19258-2233-4ca2-b1ae-193798e2c9d8&http%3a%2f%2fschemas.microsoft.com%2faccesscontrolservice%2f2010%2f07%2fclaims%2fidentityprovider=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&Audience=urn%3aWindowsAzureMediaServices&ExpiresOn=1421330840&Issuer=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&HMACSHA256=uf69n82KlqZmkJDNxhJkOxpyIpA2HDyeGUTtSnq1vlE%3d\",\n       \"expires_in\":\"21600\",\n       \"scope\":\"urn:WindowsAzureMediaServices\"\n    }\n    \n\n>[AZURE.NOTE]\nIt is recommended to cache the \"access_token \" and \"expires_in \" values to an external storage. The token data could later be retrieved from the storage and re-used in your Media Services REST API calls. This is especially useful for scenarios where the token can be securely shared among multiple processes or computers.\n\nMake sure to monitor the \"expires_in\" value of the access token and update your REST API calls with new tokens as needed.\n\n###Connecting to the Media Services URI\n\nThe root URI for Media Services is https://media.windows.net/. You should initially connect to this URI, and if you get a 301 redirect back in response, you should make subsequent calls to the new URI. In addition, do not use any auto-redirect/follow logic in your requests. HTTP verbs and request bodies will not be forwarded to the new URI.\n\nNote that the root URI for uploading and downloading Asset files is https://yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/ where the storage account name is the same one you used during your Media Services account setup.\n\nThe following example demonstrates HTTP request to the Media Services root URI (https://media.windows.net/). The request gets a 301 redirect back in response. The subsequent request is using the new URI (https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/).     \n\n**HTTP Request**:\n    \n    GET https://media.windows.net/ HTTP/1.1\n    Authorization: Bearer http%3a%2f%2fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2fws%2f2005%2f05%2fidentity%2fclaims%2fnameidentifier=amstestaccount001&urn%3aSubscriptionId=z7f19258-6753-4ca2-b1ae-193798e2c9d8&http%3a%2f%2fschemas.microsoft.com%2faccesscontrolservice%2f2010%2f07%2fclaims%2fidentityprovider=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&Audience=urn%3aWindowsAzureMediaServices&ExpiresOn=1421500579&Issuer=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&HMACSHA256=ElVWXOnMVggFQl%2ft9vhdcv1qH1n%2fE8l3hRef4zPmrzg%3d\n    x-ms-version: 2.9\n    Accept: application/json\n    Host: media.windows.net\n\n\n**HTTP Response**:\n    \n    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n    Location: https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/\n    Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.5\n    request-id: 987d7652-497a-44e5-b815-f492e02aef97\n    x-ms-request-id: 987d7652-497a-44e5-b815-f492e02aef97\n    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET\n    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\n    Date: Sat, 17 Jan 2015 07:44:53 GMT\n    Content-Length: 164\n    \n    <html><head><title>Object moved</title></head><body>\n    <h2>Object moved to <a href=\"https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/\">here</a>.</h2>\n    </body></html>\n\n\n**HTTP Request** (using the new URI):\n            \n    GET https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/ HTTP/1.1\n    Authorization: Bearer http%3a%2f%2fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2fws%2f2005%2f05%2fidentity%2fclaims%2fnameidentifier=amstestaccount001&urn%3aSubscriptionId=z7f19258-2233-4ca2-b1ae-193798e2c9d8&http%3a%2f%2fschemas.microsoft.com%2faccesscontrolservice%2f2010%2f07%2fclaims%2fidentityprovider=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&Audience=urn%3aWindowsAzureMediaServices&ExpiresOn=1421500579&Issuer=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&HMACSHA256=ElVWXOnMVggFQl%2ft9vhdcv1qH1n%2fE8l3hRef4zPmrzg%3d\n    x-ms-version: 2.9\n    Accept: application/json\n    Host: wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net\n\n\n**HTTP Response**:\n    \n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Cache-Control: no-cache\n    Content-Length: 1250\n    Content-Type: application/json;odata=minimalmetadata;streaming=true;charset=utf-8\n    Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.5\n    request-id: 5f52ea9d-177e-48fe-9709-24953d19f84a\n    x-ms-request-id: 5f52ea9d-177e-48fe-9709-24953d19f84a\n    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n    DataServiceVersion: 3.0;\n    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET\n    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\n    Date: Sat, 17 Jan 2015 07:44:52 GMT\n    \n    {\"odata.metadata\":\"https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/$metadata\",\"value\":[{\"name\":\"AccessPolicies\",\"url\":\"AccessPolicies\"},{\"name\":\"Locators\",\"url\":\"Locators\"},{\"name\":\"ContentKeys\",\"url\":\"ContentKeys\"},{\"name\":\"ContentKeyAuthorizationPolicyOptions\",\"url\":\"ContentKeyAuthorizationPolicyOptions\"},{\"name\":\"ContentKeyAuthorizationPolicies\",\"url\":\"ContentKeyAuthorizationPolicies\"},{\"name\":\"Files\",\"url\":\"Files\"},{\"name\":\"Assets\",\"url\":\"Assets\"},{\"name\":\"AssetDeliveryPolicies\",\"url\":\"AssetDeliveryPolicies\"},{\"name\":\"IngestManifestFiles\",\"url\":\"IngestManifestFiles\"},{\"name\":\"IngestManifestAssets\",\"url\":\"IngestManifestAssets\"},{\"name\":\"IngestManifests\",\"url\":\"IngestManifests\"},{\"name\":\"StorageAccounts\",\"url\":\"StorageAccounts\"},{\"name\":\"Tasks\",\"url\":\"Tasks\"},{\"name\":\"NotificationEndPoints\",\"url\":\"NotificationEndPoints\"},{\"name\":\"Jobs\",\"url\":\"Jobs\"},{\"name\":\"TaskTemplates\",\"url\":\"TaskTemplates\"},{\"name\":\"JobTemplates\",\"url\":\"JobTemplates\"},{\"name\":\"MediaProcessors\",\"url\":\"MediaProcessors\"},{\"name\":\"EncodingReservedUnitTypes\",\"url\":\"EncodingReservedUnitTypes\"},{\"name\":\"Operations\",\"url\":\"Operations\"},{\"name\":\"StreamingEndpoints\",\"url\":\"StreamingEndpoints\"},{\"name\":\"Channels\",\"url\":\"Channels\"},{\"name\":\"Programs\",\"url\":\"Programs\"}]}\n     \n\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] Once you get the new URI, that is the URI that should be used to communicate with Media Services. \n\n\n<!-- Anchors. -->\n\n\n<!-- URLs. -->\n \ntest\n"
