ACRs are set to a specific volume and contain the iSCSI Qualified Names (IQNs) of the hosts. When a host tries to connect to a volume, the device checks the ACR associated with that volume for the IQN name and if there is a match, then the connection is established. The access control records section on the **Configure** page displays all the access control records with the corresponding IQNs of the hosts.\n\nThis tutorial explains the following common ACR-related tasks:\n\n- Add an access control record \n- Edit an access control record \n- Delete an access control record \n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] \n> \n> - When assigning an ACR to a volume, take care that the volume is not concurrently accessed by more than one non-clustered host because this could corrupt the volume. \n> - When deleting an ACR from a volume, make sure that the corresponding host is not accessing the volume because the deletion could result in a read-write disruption.\n\n## Add an access control record\n\nYou use the StorSimple Manager service **Configure** page to add ACRs. Typically, you will associate one ACR with one volume.\n\nPerform the following steps to add an ACR.\n\n#### To add an access control record\n\n1. On the service landing page, select your service, double-click the service name, and then click the **Configure** tab.\n\n2. In the tabular listing under **Access control records**, supply a **Name** for your ACR.\n\n3. Provide the IQN name of your Windows host under **iSCSI Initiator Name**. To get the IQN of your Windows Server host, do the following:\n\n   - Start the Microsoft iSCSI initiator on your Windows host.\n   - In the iSCSI Initiator Properties window, on the Configuration tab, select and copy the string from the Initiator Name field.\n   - Paste this string in the **iSCSI Initiator Name** field on the ACRs table in the Management Portal.\n\n4. Click **Save** to save the newly created ACR. The tabular listing will be updated to reflect this addition.\n\n## Edit an access control record\n\nYou use the **Configure** page in the Management Portal to edit ACRs. \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] You can modify only those ACRs that are currently not in use. To edit an ACR associated with a volume that is currently in use, you must first take the volume offline.\n\nPerform the following steps to edit an ACR.\n\n#### To edit an access control record\n\n1. On the service landing page, select your service, double-click the service name, and then click the **Configure** tab.\n\n2. In the tabular listing of the access control records, hover over the ACR that you wish to modify.\n\n3. Supply a new name and/or IQN for the ACR.\n\n4. Click **Save** to save the modified ACR. The tabular listing will be updated to reflect this change.\n\n## Delete an access control record\n\nYou use the **Configure** page in the Management Portal to delete ACRs. \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] You can delete only those ACRs that are currently not in use. To delete an ACR associated with a volume that is currently in use, you must first take the volume offline.\n\nPerform the following steps to delete an access control record.\n\n#### To delete an access control record\n\n1. On the service landing page, select your service, double-click the service name, and then click the **Configure** tab.\n\n2. In the tabular listing of the access control records (ACRs), hover over the ACR that you wish to delete.\n\n3. A delete icon (**x**) will appear in the extreme right column for the ACR that you select. Click the **x** icon to delete the ACR.\n\n4. When prompted for confirmation, click **YES** to continue with the deletion. The tabular listing will be updated to reflect the deletion.\n\n## Next steps\n\nRead more about [managing StorSimple volumes](storsimple-manage-volumes.md).\n\n "
